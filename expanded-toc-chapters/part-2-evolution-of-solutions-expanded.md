### 5.3 The Raft Revolution (2013)

#### 5.3.1 Design Philosophy

- **The Understandability Thesis**
  - **Problem Statement**
    - Paxos notoriously difficult
    - Students struggle
    - Implementations vary widely
    - Few understand full Multi-Paxos
    - Production bugs from misunderstanding

  - **Raft Design Principles**
    1. Decomposition: Separate concerns
       - Leader election (who's in charge?)
       - Log replication (replicate entries)
       - Safety (correctness properties)
       - Membership changes (reconfiguration)
    2. State space reduction
       - Logs never have holes
       - Leader has all committed entries
       - No "learned" vs. "chosen" distinction
       - Simpler to reason about
    3. Strong leader: Simplify with centralization
       - Logs flow only leader → followers
       - Leader never overwrites log
       - Easier correctness arguments

- **Separation of Concerns**
  - **Classic Paxos: Intertwined**
    - Any node can propose
    - No clear leader
    - Value choice + replication + leader change mixed
    - Complex interactions

  - **Raft: Clean Separation**
    - Leader Election
      - Randomized timeouts
      - Higher term wins
      - Simple vote counting
    - Log Replication
      - AppendEntries RPC
      - Match index tracking
      - Consistency checks
    - Safety
      - Election restriction
      - Leader completeness property
      - Proven separately

- **Strong Leader Principle**
  - **Implications**
    - Only leader appends entries
    - Followers don't accept from clients
    - Simplifies commitment logic
    - Trade-off: Single bottleneck

  - **Comparison: Leaderless (EPaxos) vs. Strong Leader (Raft)**
    - Leaderless
      - Pros: Geographic locality, load balancing
      - Cons: Complex conflicts, harder reasoning
    - Strong Leader
      - Pros: Simpler model, easier implementation
      - Cons: Geographic bottleneck, leader overload
    - Use case selection

- **Randomized Timeouts**
  - **Election Timeout Design**
    - Random range (e.g., 150-300ms)
    - Prevents split votes
    - Probability analysis
    - Expected elections to converge: < 3

  - **Why Randomization Works**
    - Low probability of exact collision
    - Self-stabilizing property
    - Eventually converges
    - Mathematical foundations

  - **Tuning in Production**
    - Data center: 150-300ms typical
    - WAN: 500-1000ms may be needed
    - NVMe/fast disk: 50-150ms possible
    - Network variance considerations

#### 5.3.2 Protocol Mechanics

- **Leader Election Details**
  - **State Transitions**
    - Follower → Candidate
      - Trigger: Election timeout
      - Actions: Increment term, vote self, send RequestVote
    - Candidate → Leader
      - Trigger: Majority votes
      - Actions: Send heartbeats, init nextIndex/matchIndex
    - Candidate → Follower
      - Trigger: Higher term or valid leader
      - Actions: Update term, reset votedFor
    - Leader → Follower
      - Trigger: Higher term discovered
      - Actions: Step down immediately

  - **RequestVote RPC**
    - Message fields
      - term, candidate_id
      - last_log_index, last_log_term
    - Response fields
      - term, vote_granted
    - Protobuf definition example

  - **Vote Granting Logic**
    - Reject if term old
    - Update if term higher
    - Check already voted
    - Verify candidate log up-to-date
      - Compare last log term
      - If equal, compare index
    - Code example with all checks

- **Log Replication Rules**
  - **AppendEntries RPC**
    - Message fields
      - term, leader_id
      - prev_log_index, prev_log_term
      - entries[], leader_commit
    - Response fields
      - term, success
      - conflict_index, conflict_term (optimization)

  - **Leader's Replication Logic**
    - Track nextIndex[] and matchIndex[] per follower
    - Send AppendEntries with prev_log checks
    - Handle success: Update indices
    - Handle failure: Decrement nextIndex, retry
    - Conflict optimization
    - Commitment logic
    - Code examples

  - **Follower's Processing**
    - Reject if term old
    - Update term if higher
    - Reset election timer (leader alive)
    - Check prev_log consistency
    - Conflict response generation
    - Append entries
    - Delete conflicting entries
    - Update commit index
    - Apply to state machine
    - Code examples

- **Safety Properties**
  - **Election Safety**
    - At most one leader per term
    - Proof: Majority quorum, can't overlap

  - **Leader Append-Only**
    - Leader never deletes/overwrites
    - Only appends new entries
    - Simplifies reasoning

  - **Log Matching Property**
    - If entries have same index and term:
      1. Store same command
      2. All preceding identical
    - Proof by induction

  - **Leader Completeness**
    - Committed entry in term T appears in all leaders > T
    - Proof sketch
    - RequestVote log checking

  - **State Machine Safety**
    - If server applied entry at index i, no other applies different
    - Follows from Leader Completeness + Log Matching

- **Joint Consensus (Membership Changes)**
  - **Problem: Naive Approach Fails**
    - Example: {A,B,C} → {A,B,C,D,E}
    - Old majority {A,B} vs new {D,E,?}
    - Split brain possible

  - **Raft Solution: Joint Configuration**
    - Phase 1: C_old,new (joint)
      - Requires majority of BOTH C_old AND C_new
      - No split brain possible
    - Phase 2: C_new (new only)
      - Once C_old,new committed
      - Transition to C_new

  - **Message Flow**
    - Leader receives new config
    - Appends C_old,new (takes effect immediately)
    - Replicates and commits (both majorities)
    - Appends C_new
    - Replicates (only C_new majority)

  - **Safety Invariant**
    - During joint consensus, neither C_old nor C_new can unilaterally elect
    - Proof of no split-brain

- **ReadIndex Protocol (Linearizable Reads)**
  - **Problem: Leader Might Be Stale**
    - Network partition
    - New leader elected
    - Old "leader" doesn't know
    - Stale reads possible

  - **ReadIndex Solution**
    - Record commit index
    - Send heartbeat to confirm leadership
    - Wait for commit index advancement
    - Execute read from state machine
    - Code example

  - **Cost Analysis**
    - 1 round trip for linearizable read
    - Heartbeat + majority acks
    - Trade-off vs. writing no-op

- **Lease-Based Reads (Optimization)**
  - **Idea: Leader Maintains Lease**
    - During lease: Serve reads locally
    - No consensus needed
    - Much faster

  - **Protocol**
    - Extend lease on heartbeat ack
    - Lease = election_timeout
    - Safe to read if lease valid
    - Fall back to ReadIndex if expired
    - Code example

  - **Trade-off**
    - Much faster reads (local, no RPC)
    - Requires bounded clock skew
    - If skew > election_timeout, might violate linearizability

  - **Production Usage**
    - etcd: Supports both ReadIndex and lease
    - CockroachDB: Lease with clock uncertainty
    - TiKV: ReadIndex default, lease optional

#### 5.3.3 Production Optimizations

- **Batching Strategies**
  - **Problem: Per-Request Overhead High**
    - Every request triggers Raft
    - Network overhead
    - Disk overhead
    - CPU overhead

  - **Solution: Batch Requests**
    - Pending request queue
    - Flush on size threshold or timeout
    - Single Raft entry for batch
    - Amortize costs

  - **Implementation**
    - Batch timeout (e.g., 10ms)
    - Batch size (e.g., 100)
    - Whichever comes first
    - Code example

  - **Performance Impact (etcd)**
    - Without batching: 10k req/sec, 50ms p99
    - With batching: 100k req/sec, 60ms p99
    - Throughput 10x, latency slightly higher

- **Pipeline Replication**
  - **Problem: Sequential Replication Slow**
    - Wait for entry N
    - Then send entry N+1
    - Underutilizes network

  - **Pipeline Approach**
    - Don't wait for response
    - Send next entries immediately
    - Track in-flight requests
    - Keep network pipes full

  - **Benefits and Challenges**
    - Amortize RTT
    - Higher throughput
    - Need flow control
    - Out-of-order responses
    - Complex state tracking

- **Snapshot Transfers**
  - **Problem: Large Gaps**
    - New follower or lagging follower
    - Needs many log entries
    - Slow and expensive

  - **InstallSnapshot RPC**
    - Message fields
    - Chunked transfer
    - Offset tracking
    - Done flag

  - **Transfer Protocol**
    - Send in chunks (e.g., 1MB)
    - Follower assembles
    - Update nextIndex after completion
    - Code example

  - **Optimizations**
    - Streaming snapshots
    - Separate network connection
    - Throttling
    - Incremental snapshots

- **Pre-Vote Optimization**
  - **Problem: Partitioned Node Disrupts**
    - Node partitioned
    - Repeatedly times out
    - Increments term to 1000
    - Rejoins
    - Causes unnecessary elections

  - **Pre-Vote Solution**
    - Ask "would you vote for me?" first
    - Don't increment term
    - Only start real election if would win
    - Code example

  - **Benefit**
    - Partitioned nodes don't disrupt on rejoin
    - No unnecessary elections
    - Used in etcd, TiKV

### 5.4 Modern Consensus (2020-2025)

#### 5.4.1 Leaderless Protocols

- **EPaxos Design (2013)**
  - **Innovation: No Leader**
    - Commands executed in dependency order
    - Partial order vs. total order
    - Non-conflicting parallel execution

  - **Core Idea**
    - Instead of A → B → C → D
    - Use A → C, B → D (if no conflicts)
    - Conflict detection

  - **Message Flow**
    - Fast path (no conflicts)
      - Client to replica R
      - R calculates dependencies
      - PRE-ACCEPT to all
      - If all agree: ACCEPT and commit (2 RTT)
    - Slow path (conflicts)
      - Different dependencies detected
      - PAXOS-ACCEPT with union
      - 3-4 RTT

  - **Dependency Tracking**
    - Interference check
    - Read-write conflicts
    - Write-write conflicts
    - Execution in dependency order
    - Code examples

  - **Trade-offs**
    - Advantages
      - Low latency for non-conflicting
      - Geographic load balancing
      - No single bottleneck
    - Disadvantages
      - O(N²) conflict matrix space
      - Garbage collection complex
      - Dependency tracking expensive
      - Complex to implement
    - When EPaxos wins vs. loses

- **BPaxos (Balanced Paxos, 2021)**
  - **Problem: EPaxos Conflict Handling Expensive**

  - **Innovation: Pre-Partition by Conflict Groups**
    - Partition commands by key ranges
    - Each group runs independent Paxos
    - No cross-group dependencies

  - **Benefits Over EPaxos**
    - No dependency tracking within group
    - Simple Paxos per group
    - Easy to reason about

  - **Challenges**
    - Multi-key transactions need coordination
    - Partition imbalance
    - Not truly leaderless (leader per group)

- **Caesar Consensus (2022)**
  - Evolution: Fast path for read-write transactions
  - Generalized fast path conditions
  - Timestamp-based conflict detection
  - Research phase (not widely adopted yet)

#### 5.4.2 Hierarchical Consensus

- **Architecture Pattern**
  - **Motivation: Single Cluster Doesn't Scale to Planet**

  - **Solution: Multiple Layers**
    - Global Layer
      - Configuration consensus
      - Cross-region coordination
      - Infrequent updates (seconds to minutes)
    - Regional Layer
      - Region-wide state
      - Multi-datacenter coordination
      - Moderate frequency (subseconds)
    - Local Layer
      - Single datacenter
      - High-frequency updates (milliseconds)
      - Raft/Paxos per group

  - **Example: Google Spanner**
    - Universe: Global configuration via Paxos
    - Regions: Independent failure domains
    - Zones: Paxos groups for data shards (~1000s per zone)

- **Flexible Quorum Placement**
  - **Optimization: Place Replicas Where Clients Are**
    - Traditional: Symmetric placement
    - Flexible: Asymmetric placement

  - **Example**
    - 3 replicas in US-East (most clients)
    - 2 replicas in EU
    - Quorum: 3 out of 5
    - Most requests satisfied locally

  - **With Flexible Paxos**
    - Q1=3, Q2=3: Standard
    - Q1=2, Q2=4: Optimize for reads
    - Q1=4, Q2=2: Optimize for writes

#### 5.4.3 Kafka Evolution (KIP-500)

- **Historical Context**
  - **Old Kafka Architecture (2011-2021)**
    - ZooKeeper for metadata
      - Controller election
      - Topic metadata
      - Partition assignments
      - ACLs, configs
    - Kafka brokers for data
      - Log storage
      - Custom replication protocol
      - Serving clients

  - **Problems**
    - ZooKeeper operational overhead (separate cluster)
    - Metadata scalability limits (~200k partitions)
    - Split brain risk
    - Different tuning/monitoring

- **KIP-500: Removing ZooKeeper**
  - **Design: Kafka's Own Raft-Based Metadata Log**
    - Architecture
      - Controller Quorum (3-5 nodes)
      - Raft for metadata consensus
      - Metadata log (like Kafka data log)
      - Leader is "active controller"
      - Broker nodes follow metadata log

  - **Migration Path (2021-2024)**
    - Phase 1: Bridge mode (KRaft + ZooKeeper)
    - Phase 2: KRaft-only mode
    - Phase 3: ZooKeeper deprecation (Kafka 4.0, 2024)

- **Metadata Log Implementation**
  - **Raft Usage**
    - Metadata topics: __cluster_metadata
    - Replicated via Raft
    - Compacted log
    - Snapshots at intervals

  - **Entry Types**
    - RegisterBroker
    - CreateTopic
    - AlterPartition
    - ConfigChange

  - **Controller as Leader**
    - Propose to Raft
    - Apply to metadata cache
    - Notify brokers
    - Code example

- **Performance Improvements**
  - **Metadata Scalability**
    - ZooKeeper-based (Kafka 2.x)
      - Max partitions: ~200,000
      - Failover: 30-60 seconds
      - Propagation: 1-5 seconds
    - KRaft-based (Kafka 3.3+)
      - Max partitions: Millions (tested to 10M)
      - Failover: < 1 second
      - Propagation: 100-500ms

  - **Real-World Migration: LinkedIn**
    - 4,000 brokers, 2M partitions
    - Before: 5 ZK nodes, 45s failover, 50-100ms p99, 2-3 incidents/month
    - After: 5 controller nodes, <1s failover, 5-10ms p99, <1 incident/quarter
    - 6 months migration, zero downtime

- **Exactly-Once Semantics**
  - **Producer Idempotence**
    - Producer ID assignment
    - Sequence numbers
    - Duplicate detection
    - Code example

  - **Transactional Guarantees**
    - Transaction Coordinator
    - Transaction state in metadata
    - Raft for consistency
    - BEGIN_TXN, COMMIT_TXN flow
    - Consumer isolation levels

### 5.5 Consensus in Practice (2020-2025)

#### 5.5.1 Production Consensus Deployments

- **The Context: Consensus Became Infrastructure**
  - By 2020, consensus on critical path
  - Problems papers didn't anticipate
  - Planetary-scale challenges
  - Real incidents drive innovation

- **Kubernetes etcd at Scale (1M+ Objects)**
  - **Historical Context**
    - 2014: K8s uses etcd
    - 2016: First 100k object clusters struggle
    - 2018: 500k object clusters fail regularly
    - 2020: 1M+ clusters needed urgently

  - **The Problem: Production Incident (Google, 2018)**
    - Cluster: 15,000 nodes, 750k objects
    - etcd: 5 nodes, 32GB RAM
    - Failure mode timeline
      1. Rolling update starts (1000 pods/min)
      2. etcd write throughput: 10k/sec
      3. Raft log grows rapidly
      4. Leader lags on heartbeats
      5. Followers trigger election
      6. New leader must catch up
      7. Catch-up takes 30+ seconds
      8. Another election triggered
      9. Election storm begins
      10. Cluster unavailable 8 minutes
    - Impact: All K8s API fails, no scheduling, $2M+ revenue

  - **Failed Attempts**
    1. "Just add more nodes" (2017)
       - 5 to 7 nodes
       - Worse: More overhead
       - Quorum 4/7 vs 3/5
       - Write latency +40%
       - Abandoned after 2 weeks
    2. "Bigger machines" (2017)
       - 64GB RAM, faster CPUs
       - Only delayed problem
       - Memory filled faster
       - CPU not bottleneck (network was)
       - Bought 6 months only
    3. "Tune Raft parameters" (2018)
       - Longer heartbeats, bigger batches
       - Worse availability during real failures
       - False positives vs. real failures trade-off
       - Abandoned after incident

  - **The Breakthrough Insight**
    - Problem wasn't Raft—how etcd used Raft
    - Key realizations
      1. Most reads don't need linearizability
      2. Watch operations dominate (not snapshot reads)
      3. Log compaction was synchronous (blocked writes)
      4. Snapshot transfer blocked new entries
      5. All nodes doing same work (inefficient)

  - **The Solution: etcd v3.4+ Optimizations (2019-2020)**

    **Optimization 1: Asynchronous Log Compaction**
    - Old approach (v3.0-3.3)
      - Compaction in apply loop
      - Blocks until complete
      - 2-5 seconds for large datasets
    - New approach (v3.4+)
      - Background goroutine
      - Non-blocking signal
      - Periodic compaction
      - Code example (Go)
    - Impact
      - Apply loop latency: 5s → 5ms (1000x)
      - Leader election rate: -90%
      - Write throughput: +3x

    **Optimization 2: Learner Nodes (Non-Voting Replicas)**
    - Problem: Slow replicas affect quorum
    - Scenario before learners
      - 5 nodes: 3 US-East, 1 US-West, 1 EU
      - Need 3/5 for quorum
      - If EU in quorum → 150ms latency
      - If EU excluded → No regional redundancy
    - Solution: Learner Nodes
      - Voters: Participate in quorum
      - Learners: Receive log, don't vote
      - Code example (Go)
    - Learner Promotion Protocol
      - Verify caught up
      - Propose through Raft
      - Wait for commit
      - Code example
    - Production Results (K8s, 2020)
      - Before: 3 voters US-East, 2 voters remote, 180ms p99, 99.5% availability
      - After: 3 voters US-East, 2 learners remote, 15ms p99, 99.95% availability

    **Optimization 3: Batch Append Optimization**
    - The Problem
      - 50k writes/sec
      - Each write 100 bytes
      - Raft logs: 5MB/sec
      - fsync latency: 10ms
      - Max 100 writes/sec per fsync!
    - Naive Batching (doesn't work)
      - Fixed-size batching
      - Last writes in partial batch wait forever
    - Production Solution: Adaptive Batching
      - Batch interval (e.g., 10ms)
      - Force flush at size threshold
      - Periodic flush for small batches
      - Code example (Go)
    - Pipelining Optimization
      - Don't wait for disk before followers
      - Send to followers parallel with disk write
      - Code example
    - Performance Results
      - v3.3 (no batching): 8k writes/sec, 25ms p50, 120ms p99
      - v3.4 (with batching): 45k/sec, 8ms p50, 35ms p99
      - v3.5 (with pipelining): 120k/sec, 3ms p50, 18ms p99

- **CockroachDB's Parallel Commits (2019)**
  - **The Problem Statement**
    - Traditional transaction protocol
      1. Client writes to keys
      2. Client sends COMMIT
      3. Coordinator writes commit record
      4. Coordinator waits for Raft replication
      5. Coordinator responds to client
    - Latency breakdown
      - Network RTT to coordinator: 5ms
      - Raft replication: 10ms (cross-datacenter)
      - Network RTT back: 5ms
      - Total: 20ms
    - Problem: Commit latency = Raft latency

  - **Failed Attempt: Async Commit (2017)**
    - Idea: Respond before commit replicates
    - Protocol
      1. COMMIT
      2. Respond immediately
      3. Replicate in background
    - Problem discovered
      - Client reads from different node
      - Node hasn't seen commit yet
      - Read returns old data
      - Violates serializability!
    - Abandoned after 3 months

  - **The Breakthrough: Parallel Commits**
    - Key insight
      - Mark transaction committed before commit record durable
      - IF track pending transactions
      - AND can reconstruct decision
    - Analogy: Optimistic locking for commits

  - **Implementation (Go Code)**
    - Transaction structure
    - Phase 1: Parallel writes
      - Write all keys in parallel through Raft
      - Each write includes transaction metadata
      - Code example
    - Phase 2: Parallel commit
      - Mark as COMMITTED (not durable yet)
      - Write commit record async
      - Return immediately
      - Code example
    - Phase 3: Read path recovery
      - Check transaction status
      - If PENDING, recover status
      - Check all writes present
      - Code example

  - **Safety Argument**
    - Claim: Parallel commits are safe
    - Proof sketch
      1. Coordinator only returns if ALL writes replicated
      2. Each write includes full metadata
      3. If any write missing → can't be COMMITTED
      4. If all writes present → MUST be COMMITTED
      5. Reader can reconstruct deterministically
    - Invariant: If coordinator returned success, all writes durable

  - **Performance Impact**
    - Workload: Multi-region transactions (US-East ↔ US-West)
    - Before: p50=85ms, p99=150ms
    - After: p50=45ms, p99=90ms
    - Improvement: ~45% latency reduction

  - **Production War Story (2020)**
    - Customer: Large SaaS, 500k txn/sec
    - Problem: Parallel commits worked until network partition
    - Timeline
      - 10:00 AM: Partition US-East/US-West
      - 10:01 AM: Transactions still committing (good)
      - 10:05 AM: Read queries timing out
      - 10:08 AM: CPU spiking on read path
    - Root cause
      - Partition prevented coordinator access
      - Every read required status recovery
      - Recovery checked ALL writes
      - High-contention keys = many recovery attempts
      - CPU exhausted
    - Fix
      - Caching layer for transaction status
      - Limit recovery attempts
      - Background task to finalize pending
    - Deployed 2020-11, no issues since

- **FoundationDB's Deterministic Simulation (2015-present)**
  - **The Context: Testing Distributed Systems**
    - Traditional testing problems
      - Unit tests: Too isolated
      - Integration tests: Miss rare races
      - Chaos engineering: Random, hard to reproduce
      - Production issues: Expensive to debug
    - FoundationDB realization (after 2012 data loss)
      - "Can't test to correctness with traditional methods"
      - "Need something radically different"

  - **The Innovation: Deterministic Simulation**
    - Core idea
      - Run distributed system in single process
      - Simulate network, disk, time
      - All deterministically
    - Same seed = Same execution every time
    - Found bugs replay infinitely

  - **Implementation Architecture (Rust Code)**
    - Simulator structure
      - Deterministic PRNG (seeded)
      - Virtual time (not wall clock)
      - Event queue (sorted by time)
      - Virtual network
      - Virtual machines
    - Simulator run_simulation method
    - deliver_message with random delays
    - inject_failures randomly
    - SimulatedNetwork (no real sockets)
    - SimulatedDisk (in-memory with latency)

  - **Test Workload Generator (Rust Code)**
    - Setup cluster
    - Generate load
    - Inject failures randomly
    - Verify correctness
    - Code example

  - **Bug Discovery Example (Real bug, 2015)**
    - Bug: Leader election during disk stall
    - Test seed: 0x7f8a3c2e19b4
    - Sequence timeline
      - T=0ms: Node1 becomes leader (term 5)
      - T=100ms: Node1 starts disk write
      - T=105ms: Disk latency spike (simulated 500ms)
      - T=200ms: Node1 misses heartbeat
      - T=201ms: Node2 starts election (term 6)
      - T=210ms: Node2 becomes leader
      - T=600ms: Node1's disk write completes
      - T=601ms: Node1 thinks it's still leader, sends term 5
      - T=602ms: Node3 has two leaders in cache
    - ASSERTION FAILED: Multiple leaders in same term
    - Root cause: Leader didn't check term after disk I/O
    - Fix: Re-check term after any blocking operation

  - **Production Impact Statistics (FDB, 2012-2025)**
    - Bugs found via simulation: 1,247
    - Bugs found in production: 13
    - Mean time to find bugs
      - Simulation: 4.2 hours
      - Production: 18.3 days
    - Most complex bug found
      - Seed: 0x3fb8a9c4e5d2
      - Simulated time: 947 hours
      - Real time: 6 hours
      - Required: 3 crashes, 2 partitions, 1 disk stall, specific timing
      - Probability in production: ~1 in 10 billion hours
      - Would have caused data loss

  - **Why This Works**
    1. Determinism
       - Same seed = same bugs
       - Replay trivially
       - Binary search through time
       - Add logging retroactively
    2. Speed
       - Simulated time >> wall time
       - 1000x faster than real time
       - Test years in hours
       - Find rare races
    3. Completeness
       - Controlled environment
       - Inject any failure
       - No flaky tests
       - Coverage measurable
    4. Falsifiability
       - Actively look for violations
       - Assert liberally
       - Fail fast

  - **Adoption in Industry**
    - FoundationDB (2012): Original
    - MongoDB (2020): Replica sets
    - TigerBeetle (2021): Built-in from day one
    - Convex (2022): Simulation-tested transactions
    - Emerging pattern: "If building distributed database in 2025, simulation testing is table stakes"

- **MongoDB's Raft Implementation (2019-present)**
  - **Historical Context**
    - 2009-2019: Custom replication protocol
      - Elect master via priority
      - Rollback on failover
      - Occasionally lost data
    - 2019: Replace with Raft
    - Goal: Never lose acknowledged writes
    - Challenge: 100M+ deployments, can't break compatibility

  - **The Migration Strategy (Rust Code)**
    - Phase 1: Implement Raft alongside existing
      - ReplicaSetCoordinator structure
      - Old protocol still running
      - New Raft optional
      - Feature flag
    - Phase 2: Parallel operation
      - Run both protocols
      - Compare results
      - Log discrepancies
      - Don't break existing
    - Phase 3: Gradual rollout
      - Enable Raft in new deployments (2020)
      - Opt-in for existing (2021)
      - Default for new versions (2022)
      - Deprecate old protocol (2024)

  - **Raft Customizations for MongoDB (Rust Code)**
    - Customization 1: Priority-based elections
      - Backwards compatibility
      - Low priority waits longer
      - High priority starts immediately
      - Vote consideration of priority
      - Code example
    - Customization 2: Write concern integration
      - WriteConcern enum (Majority, Acknowledged, Unacknowledged, Custom)
      - Map MongoDB semantics to Raft
      - Code example
    - Customization 3: Rollback-free failover
      - Preserve MongoDB rollback behavior where needed
      - Save uncommitted entries to rollback log
      - Code example

  - **Production Results (MongoDB 4.4+, 2020-2025)**
    - Table comparison
      - Data loss incidents/year: 12-15 → 0
      - False failovers/year: 50+ → 3
      - Rollback frequency: Common → Rare
      - Failover time p99: 45s → 12s
      - Community confidence: Medium → High

#### 5.5.2 Performance Optimizations at Scale

- **Leader Lease Optimizations**
  - **The Read Problem**
    - Standard Raft: All reads through consensus
    - Process: Request, propose no-op, wait quorum, return
    - Cost: Every read = 1 Raft consensus round
    - Impact: Read throughput limited

  - **The Breakthrough: Leader Leases**
    - Idea: Leader gets time-bound lease
    - During lease: Serve reads without consensus
    - After lease: Must renew or step down
    - Key insight: Bound clock skew ε
    - Safe until T + D - ε

  - **Implementation (Rust Code)**
    - LeaderLease structure
    - acquire_lease through Raft
    - can_serve_read_locally check
    - read method with fast/slow path
    - Code example

  - **Follower Read Protocol (Rust Code)**
    - Check commit index
    - Ask leader for commit index
    - If caught up: Read locally
    - Otherwise: Forward to leader
    - Code example

  - **Performance Impact**
    - Workload: 90% reads, 10% writes
    - Without leases: 10-15ms latency, 10k reads/sec, 80% CPU
    - With leases (10s duration): 0.1-0.5ms, 500k reads/sec, 15% CPU
    - 50x improvement on read-heavy workloads

- **Batching and Pipelining Strategies**
  - **Multi-Raft Batching (TiKV Implementation, Rust Code)**
    - TiKV runs 1000s of Raft groups per node
    - Naive: Each group sends heartbeats independently
    - Problem: 1000 groups × 5 nodes = 5000 messages/sec just for heartbeats
    - MultiRaftBatcher structure
    - run_batch_loop method
    - Collect messages by destination
    - Send one batched message per destination
    - Code example

  - **Results**
    - TiKV cluster: 1000 Raft groups, 5 nodes
    - Without batching: 50k packets/sec, 25% CPU, 10ms p99
    - With batching (10ms intervals): 500 packets/sec, 2% CPU, 12ms p99
    - 100x reduction in network overhead

- **Log Compaction Under Load**
  - **The Problem**
    - Raft log grows forever without compaction
    - Compaction expensive: blocks writes
    - Need: Compact without stopping the world

  - **Incremental Compaction (CockroachDB, Rust Code)**
    - IncrementalCompactor structure
    - CompactionProgress tracking
    - incremental_compact called periodically
    - Process KEYS_PER_ITERATION at a time
    - finalize_snapshot when complete
    - Code example

- **Snapshot Transfer at Scale**
  - **Problem: Large Snapshots Block**
    - Transferring 100GB snapshot
    - Naive: Generate (10 min), send (30 min), apply (10 min)
    - Total: 50 minutes follower can't catch up

  - **Streaming Snapshot Protocol (Rust Code)**
    - StreamingSnapshot with chunks
    - send_snapshot_streaming
    - Send chunks in parallel with log replication
    - Yield between chunks
    - receive_snapshot_streaming
    - tokio::select! to handle both chunks and entries
    - Apply complete snapshot + buffered entries
    - Code example

#### 5.5.3 Operational Challenges

- **Leader Election Storms**
  - **The Problem: Production Incident (2021)**
    1. Network hiccup causes leader timeout
    2. Follower starts election (term 100)
    3. Wins, becomes leader
    4. Network hiccup again
    5. Another election (term 101)
    6. Repeat 50 times in 2 minutes
    7. No progress: all time spent on elections

  - **Root Cause Analysis**
    - Problematic configuration
      - HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 100ms
      - ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MIN: 150ms
      - ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MAX: 300ms
    - Problem: Not enough separation
      - Network jitter: ~50ms p99
      - Ratio: election/heartbeat = only 1.5x
      - Too sensitive to variance

  - **Solution: Pre-Vote Protocol (Raft §9, Rust Code)**
    - VoteType enum (PreVote, RealVote)
    - handle_election_timeout: start_pre_vote first
    - start_pre_vote: DON'T increment term
    - handle_vote_request: Check vote_type
    - PreVote: Would I vote? (don't actually grant)
    - RealVote: Normal Raft logic
    - handle_pre_vote_responses: Only start real if would win
    - Code example

  - **Impact**
    - Before pre-vote: 50+ elections/hour during partitions, 99.5% availability, 500ms p99
    - After pre-vote: 0-1 elections/hour, 99.95% availability, 50ms p99

- **Network Partition Recovery**
  - **The Scenario**
    - 5-node cluster: A,B,C in DC1; D,E in DC2
    - Network partition: DC1 ↔ DC2
    - DC1 group (A,B,C)
      - Has majority (3/5)
      - Elects leader (A)
      - Continues processing
      - Log advances to index 1,000,000
    - DC2 group (D,E)
      - No majority (2/5)
      - Cannot elect leader
      - Cannot process writes
      - Stuck at index 500,000
    - Partition heals after 1 hour
      - D and E are 500,000 entries behind
      - Naive: Send all 500,000 entries
      - At 10k entries/sec: 50 seconds
      - But cluster still processing new writes
      - D and E never catch up!

  - **Solution: Snapshot on Recovery (Rust Code)**
    - handle_append_entries_response
    - If follower too far behind (< snapshot_index)
    - Send snapshot instead of individual entries
    - Otherwise back up and retry
    - Code example

  - **Optimized Recovery with Parallel Transfer (Rust Code)**
    - fast_follower_recovery
    - Check gap size
    - If gap > SNAPSHOT_THRESHOLD
      - Task 1: Stream snapshot
      - Task 2: Buffer new entries
      - Wait for snapshot
      - Send buffered entries
    - Else normal catch-up
    - Code example

## Chapter 6: From Clocks to Causality

### 6.1 Physical Time Era (1980s-2000s)

#### 6.1.1 Early Attempts

- **NTP Deployment (1985)**
  - **Network Time Protocol Origins**
    - Developed by David Mills (University of Delaware)
    - Goal: Synchronize clocks over unreliable networks
    - Hierarchical stratum architecture
    - Still in use today (with improvements)

  - **Architecture**
    - Stratum 0: Reference clocks (atomic clocks, GPS)
    - Stratum 1: Directly connected to stratum 0
    - Stratum 2: Sync from stratum 1 servers
    - ... up to Stratum 15
    - Stratum 16: Unsynchronized

  - **Synchronization Algorithm (Python Code)**
    - NTPClient class
    - sync_with_server method
    - Four timestamps: t1, t2, t3, t4
    - Calculate offset: ((t2-t1) + (t3-t4)) / 2
    - Calculate delay: (t4-t1) - (t3-t2)
    - Adjust local clock gradually or step
    - Code example

  - **Performance**
    - Public internet: 5-100ms accuracy
    - LAN: 1-10ms accuracy
    - Problem: Too coarse for distributed transactions
    - Asymmetric delays cause issues

- **Timestamp Ordering (1979)**
  - **Distributed Database Technique**
    - Every transaction gets timestamp
    - Execute in timestamp order
    - Ensure serializability

  - **Protocol**
    - Read rule: Can read X if no TS>TS(T) has written X
    - Write rule: Can write X if no TS>TS(T) has read/written X
    - Otherwise: Abort T

  - **Example Scenario**
    - T1 (TS=100): Write(X, v1)
    - T2 (TS=101): Read(X)
    - If T2 reads before T1 writes: Abort T2

  - **Problems**
    - High abort rate with clock skew
    - Cascading aborts
    - Livelock possible
    - Not practical with physical clocks

- **Thomas Write Rule (1979)**
  - **Optimization: Ignore Outdated Writes**
    - Standard rule: If TS(T) < TS(last_write(X)), abort T
    - Thomas Write Rule: Ignore this write (don't abort)
    - Reasoning: Later transaction already wrote

  - **Benefits**
    - Fewer aborts
    - Better performance

  - **Downside**
    - Non-serializable schedules possible
    - View-serializability only

- **Berkeley Algorithm (1989)**
  - **Idea: Don't Trust Any Clock, Average Them**

  - **Protocol**
    1. Master polls all slaves for time
    2. Master estimates slave times (account for network delay)
    3. Master computes average
    4. Master sends adjustment to each slave

  - **Example**
    - Master: 12:00:00
    - Slave 1: 12:00:05
    - Slave 2: 11:59:55
    - Slave 3: 12:00:02
    - Average: 12:00:00.5
    - Adjustments calculated

  - **Problems**
    - Master is single point of failure
    - Assumes symmetric network delays
    - Byzantine faults not tolerated

#### 6.1.2 Failure Analysis

- **Clock Skew Impacts**
  - **Real-World Example 1: Database Corruption (2010)**
    - Setup: Multi-master with timestamp ordering
    - Timeline
      - 12:00:00.00 (Server A): Write(X, v1) [TS=100]
      - 12:00:00.10 (Server B): Write(X, v2) [TS=95] (clock skew!)
    - Result
      - Server A's TS higher
      - But Server B's write might be seen first
      - Replicas disagree on final value
      - Data corruption
    - Impact: 3 hours downtime, manual reconciliation, $500K loss

  - **Real-World Example 2: Kerberos Failures (2015)**
    - Setup: Authentication with 5-minute clock skew tolerance
    - Scenario
      - Client clock: 12:00:00
      - Server clock: 12:06:00 (6-minute skew)
    - Result
      - All tickets rejected as "too far in past"
      - Authentication fails
      - Service outage
    - Root cause: NTP server misconfiguration
    - Fix time: 45 minutes

- **Inversion Examples**
  - **Causality Violation**
    - Event sequence
      1. User A posts "Hello" at 12:00:00 (Server 1, clock skewed +5 min)
      2. User B replies "Hi!" at 12:01:00 (Server 2, correct clock)
    - Display order (sorted by timestamp)
      1. "Hi!" (12:01:00)
      2. "Hello" (12:05:00)
    - Result: Reply appears before original message!

  - **Make-Before-Break Violation**
    - Distributed build system
    - Node A compiles lib.c → lib.o (TS: 12:00:00, clock +5 min)
    - Node B compiles main.c → main.o (TS: 11:59:00, correct)
    - Node C links main.o + lib.o
    - Node C sees lib.o timestamp > main.o
    - Thinks lib.o changed after link
    - Spurious rebuild!

- **Lessons Learned**
  - **Key Insights**
    1. Physical clocks are unreliable
       - Crystal oscillator drift: 10-100 PPM
       - Temperature affects drift
       - Virtualization makes it worse
    2. Network delays unpredictable
       - NTP assumes symmetric delay
       - Reality: Asymmetric paths common
       - Bufferbloat adds variance
    3. Clock synchronization is hard
       - NTP good for humans, not transactions
       - GPS vulnerable to spoofing
       - Need better solution for strong consistency

---

### 6.2 Logical Time Revolution (1990s-2010s)

#### 6.2.1 Lamport Clocks (1978)

- **The Fundamental Insight**
  - Don't need to know actual time
  - Only need to know order of events
  - Happened-before relation (→)
  - Partial order, not total order

- **Happened-Before Relation**
  - **Definition**
    - a → b if:
      1. a and b in same process, a before b
      2. a is send event, b is receive event
      3. Transitive: a → b and b → c implies a → c
  - **Concurrent Events**
    - If not a → b and not b → a, then a || b (concurrent)

- **Lamport Clock Algorithm (Python Code)**
  - LamportClock class
  - Local event: Increment counter
  - Send event: Increment counter, attach to message
  - Receive event: Take max(local, message) + 1
  - Code example

- **Properties**
  - If a → b, then LC(a) < LC(b)
  - Converse not true: LC(a) < LC(b) doesn't imply a → b
  - Provides partial ordering
  - Cannot detect concurrency from clock values alone

- **Total Ordering Extension**
  - Break ties with process ID
  - (timestamp, process_id) pairs
  - Lexicographic ordering
  - Used in distributed mutual exclusion

- **Applications**
  - **Distributed Mutual Exclusion**
    - Request resource with timestamp
    - Grant to lowest timestamp
    - Release when done
    - Algorithm details

  - **Causal Message Delivery**
    - Deliver messages in causal order
    - Buffer out-of-order messages
    - Implementation strategy

  - **Debugging Distributed Systems**
    - Log events with Lamport timestamps
    - Reconstruct causal order
    - Find concurrency bugs

- **Limitations**
  - Cannot detect concurrency
  - Unbounded counter growth
  - No physical time correlation
  - Led to vector clocks

#### 6.2.2 Vector Clocks (1988)

- **Motivation: Detecting Concurrency**
  - Lamport clocks insufficient
  - Need to know if events concurrent
  - Vector tracks all process clocks

- **Vector Clock Algorithm (Python Code)**
  - VectorClock class
  - Vector of counters (one per process)
  - Local event: Increment own counter
  - Send event: Increment, attach vector
  - Receive event: Element-wise max, then increment own
  - Code example

- **Comparison Operations**
  - VC(a) ≤ VC(b): All elements a[i] ≤ b[i]
  - VC(a) < VC(b): VC(a) ≤ VC(b) and VC(a) ≠ VC(b)
  - VC(a) || VC(b): Neither VC(a) ≤ VC(b) nor VC(b) ≤ VC(a)

- **Properties**
  - If a → b, then VC(a) < VC(b)
  - If VC(a) < VC(b), then a → b (converse of Lamport!)
  - If VC(a) || VC(b), then a and b are concurrent
  - Complete characterization of causality

- **Space Overhead**
  - O(N) space per clock (N = number of processes)
  - Problem at scale (1000s of processes)
  - Messages grow with system size
  - Led to optimizations

- **Applications**
  - **Distributed Debugging**
    - Reconstruct causality
    - Identify race conditions
    - Replay executions

  - **Optimistic Replication**
    - Detect conflicts
    - Eventual consistency
    - Conflict resolution

  - **Causal Consistency**
    - Ensure causally related ops seen in order
    - Implementation details

  - **Version Vectors in Dynamo**
    - Track object versions
    - Detect concurrent writes
    - Sibling resolution

- **Optimizations**
  - **Interval Tree Clocks (2008)**
    - Reduce space overhead
    - Grow/shrink dynamically
    - Logarithmic space in active processes

  - **Dotted Version Vectors**
    - Separate server vector from client dots
    - More efficient conflict detection
    - Used in Riak

  - **Bounded Vector Clocks**
    - Limit size (e.g., 10 elements)
    - Prune least-recently-used
    - Trade accuracy for space

#### 6.2.3 Causal Consistency Models

- **Definition and Guarantees**
  - Writes that are causally related seen in order
  - Concurrent writes may be seen in any order
  - Weaker than linearizability
  - Stronger than eventual consistency

- **Implementation Strategies**
  - **Client-Side Dependency Tracking**
    - Client maintains causal context
    - Attach to writes
    - Server checks dependencies before applying

  - **Server-Side Causal Broadcast**
    - Servers broadcast writes
    - Deliver in causal order
    - Buffer out-of-order writes

  - **Hybrid Logical Clocks**
    - See section 6.3

- **Example: COPS (2011)**
  - **Clusters of Order-Preserving Servers**
    - Causal consistency for geo-replicated data
    - Get transactions
    - Put transactions with dependencies

  - **Architecture**
    - Multiple datacenters (clusters)
    - Each cluster: Key-value store
    - Cross-cluster replication
    - Dependency tracking

  - **Operations**
    - get_trans: Read multiple keys with consistent snapshot
    - put_trans: Write multiple keys with dependencies
    - Check dependencies before applying

  - **Performance**
    - Low latency (local reads/writes)
    - Eventual consistency across datacenters
    - Causal order preserved

- **Example: Eiger (2013)**
  - **Evolution of COPS**
    - Write-only transactions
    - Read-only transactions
    - Lower latency
    - Used in Facebook research

- **Example: CRIC (2021)**
  - **Causal Consistency with Read Committed**
    - Read committed isolation
    - Causal consistency
    - Efficient implementation

---

### 6.3 Hybrid Time Systems (2010s-2025)

#### 6.3.1 Hybrid Logical Clocks (2014)

- **Motivation: Best of Both Worlds**
  - Lamport clocks: Logical ordering
  - Physical clocks: Human-readable time
  - Combine both!

- **HLC Algorithm (Python Code)**
  - HybridLogicalClock class
  - Two components: physical time pt, logical counter lc
  - Local event: Update both pt and lc
  - Send event: Attach (pt, lc)
  - Receive event: Update with max logic
  - Code example

- **Properties**
  - If a → b, then HLC(a) < HLC(b)
  - HLC(a).pt ≈ actual physical time
  - Bounded drift from physical time
  - Compatible with Lamport clocks

- **Bounded Drift Proof**
  - Theorem: |HLC(e).pt - actual_time(e)| ≤ ε
  - ε is maximum clock skew
  - Proof sketch
  - Practical implications

- **Advantages Over Pure Logical Clocks**
  - Human-readable timestamps
  - Correlate with real-world events
  - Useful for debugging
  - Can use for TTLs, timeouts

- **Advantages Over Pure Physical Clocks**
  - Captures causality
  - No clock skew inversions
  - Works despite clock sync issues

- **Applications**
  - **Distributed Tracing**
    - Span timestamps with HLC
    - Reconstruct causal order
    - Handle clock skew
    - Example: OpenTelemetry integration

  - **Event Ordering**
    - Log aggregation
    - Metrics collection
    - Causal analysis

  - **Transaction Ordering**
    - CockroachDB usage
    - YugabyteDB usage
    - Calvin usage

- **Implementation Considerations**
  - Clock sync still helpful (reduces logical component)
  - Persistence required
  - Overflow handling
  - Performance overhead minimal

#### 6.3.2 TrueTime (Google Spanner, 2012)

- **The Problem: Need Real Time for Transactions**
  - External consistency requirement
  - If transaction T1 completes before T2 starts (in real time), then T1's timestamp < T2's
  - Physical clocks too inaccurate
  - Logical clocks don't give real time

- **TrueTime API**
  - TT.now() returns interval [earliest, latest]
  - Absolute certainty: True time is within interval
  - Interval width ε (typically 1-7ms)
  - GPS + atomic clock synchronization

- **Architecture**
  - **Time Masters**
    - GPS receivers
    - Atomic clocks
    - Redundancy
    - Different failure modes

  - **Time Slaves**
    - Every machine
    - Poll masters
    - Marzullo's algorithm for interval
    - Track uncertainty

  - **Uncertainty Calculation**
    - Local clock drift since last sync
    - Network delay estimate
    - Conservative bounds

- **Wait Commit Protocol (Python Code)**
  - assign_timestamp: TT.now().latest
  - Wait until TT.now().earliest > commit_timestamp
  - Then safe to commit
  - Code example

- **Why This Works**
  - Interval overlap guarantees
  - If T1 commits at time t1
  - And T2 starts at time t2 > t1
  - Then T2's timestamp will be > T1's timestamp
  - External consistency achieved

- **Implementation Challenges**
  - **Hardware Requirements**
    - GPS antennas on every datacenter
    - Atomic clocks (expensive)
    - Maintenance

  - **Wait Time Overhead**
    - Commit latency += ε (uncertainty)
    - Typical: 5ms added latency
    - Trade-off: Consistency vs. latency

  - **Failure Modes**
    - GPS signal loss (atomic clocks take over)
    - Atomic clock drift (GPS corrects)
    - Network partition (increase ε)

- **Alternative: Clock Bound Protocol**
  - No special hardware
  - Conservative uncertainty bounds
  - Larger ε (e.g., 100ms)
  - Used in YugabyteDB

#### 6.3.3 Clock Uncertainty in CockroachDB

- **Design: HLC + Uncertainty Intervals**
  - Every node has HLC
  - Track maximum clock offset (typically 500ms)
  - Uncertainty window: [timestamp - max_offset, timestamp + max_offset]

- **Read Uncertainty Handling (Go Code)**
  - When reading key
  - Check writes in uncertainty window
  - If conflicting write: Restart transaction with higher timestamp
  - Code example

- **Write Protocol**
  - Assign HLC timestamp to write
  - Replicate via Raft
  - No wait required (unlike TrueTime)
  - Trade-off: Some read restarts

- **Comparison with TrueTime**
  - CockroachDB
    - Pros: No special hardware, no commit wait
    - Cons: Read restarts on uncertainty
  - TrueTime
    - Pros: No read restarts, strict external consistency
    - Cons: Special hardware, commit wait overhead

- **Performance Characteristics**
  - Read restart rate: 1-5% typical
  - Higher with poor clock sync
  - Lower with good NTP/PTP
  - Acceptable for most workloads

- **Recent Improvements (2020-2023)**
  - Closed timestamps
  - Follower reads
  - Reduced uncertainty windows
  - Better clock sync (PTP)

### 6.4 Time in Production Systems (2015-2025)

#### 6.4.1 Clock Management at Scale

- **Facebook's Time Infrastructure**
  - **Real Production Incident (2016)**
    - Impact: $3M+ revenue loss
    - Multiple services affected
    - Root cause: NTP misconfiguration
    - Cascading failures
    - Hours to detect and fix

  - **Failed Public NTP Approach (2011-2015)**
    - Reliance on public NTP pools
    - Unpredictable accuracy
    - No SLA
    - Lessons learned
      - Can't control public servers
      - Need internal infrastructure

## Chapter 7: From Voting to Provability

### 7.1 Traditional Voting (1970s-2000s)

#### 7.1.1 2PC/3PC Analysis

- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) - 1978**
  - **The Classic Distributed Transaction Protocol**
    - Phase Structure
      - Phase 1: Voting (PREPARE)
        - Coordinator → Participants: PREPARE(txn)
        - Participants → Coordinator: YES or NO
      - Phase 2: Completion (COMMIT/ABORT)
        - If all YES: Coordinator → Participants: COMMIT
        - If any NO: Coordinator → Participants: ABORT

  - **Protocol Implementation (Python Code)**
    - TwoPhaseCoordinator class
      - execute_transaction method
      - Phase 1: Prepare all participants
      - Early abort if any NO
      - Write PREPARED to recovery log
      - Phase 2: Commit all participants
      - Write COMMITTED to log
      - Code example
    - TwoPhaseParticipant class
      - prepare method
        - Acquire locks
        - Write undo/redo logs
        - Persist PREPARED state
        - Return YES or NO
      - commit method
        - Apply changes
        - Write commit record
        - Release locks
      - Code example

  - **Blocking Scenarios**
    - Scenario 1: Coordinator crashes after PREPARE
      - Timeline
        1. Coordinator sends PREPARE
        2. All vote YES, enter PREPARED state
        3. Coordinator crashes BEFORE COMMIT/ABORT
      - Participant state
        - Holds locks
        - Cannot decide unilaterally (others might have voted NO)
        - Cannot timeout (coordinator might have decided COMMIT)
        - BLOCKED until coordinator recovers
      - Impact: Locks indefinitely, other transactions blocked, deadlock potential

    - Scenario 2: Network partition
      - Coordinator sends COMMIT to subset
      - Partition occurs
      - Remaining participants stuck in PREPARED
      - Cannot proceed (don't know decision)
      - Must wait for partition to heal
      - Real-world: Can last hours or days

  - **XA Protocol (X/Open DTP - 1991)**
    - Standardization of 2PC for heterogeneous systems
    - Interface (C code)
      - xa_open, xa_close
      - xa_start, xa_end
      - xa_prepare, xa_commit, xa_rollback
      - xa_recover
    - Limitations
      - Still subject to 2PC blocking
      - Performance overhead (multiple disk flushes)
      - Heuristic decisions (manual intervention)
      - Not widely used in modern systems

  - **Presume Abort vs. Presume Commit**
    - Presume Abort
      - Assumption: If coordinator crashes, assume ABORT
      - Benefits: No ABORT log record, coordinator can forget, participants timeout
      - Used when: Aborts more common
    - Presume Commit
      - Assumption: If uncertain, assume COMMIT
      - Benefits: No COMMIT log for read-only participants, faster commit path
      - Risks: Must log ABORT explicitly, more dangerous
      - Used when: Commits very likely

  - **Recovery Journals**
    - Coordinator Recovery (Python Code)
      - Read log from stable storage
      - For each PREPARED without outcome: Contact participants, complete
      - For each COMMITTED: Ensure all participants committed
      - Code example
    - Participant Recovery (Python Code)
      - Read log
      - For each PREPARED: Contact coordinator for outcome
      - If coordinator doesn't know: Cooperative termination protocol
      - Code example

- **Three-Phase Commit (3PC) - 1982**
  - **Attempt to Solve 2PC Blocking**
    - Phase Structure
      - Phase 1: Can-Commit? (CAN-COMMIT? / YES-NO)
      - Phase 2: Pre-Commit (PRE-COMMIT / ACK)
        - Participants enter PRE-COMMITTED state
        - Commit is now inevitable
      - Phase 3: Do-Commit (DO-COMMIT / ACK)
        - Participants actually commit

  - **Key Invariant**
    - If any participant is in PRE-COMMITTED state, no participant can be in ABORTED state
    - Allows timeout-based termination

  - **Why 3PC Fails in Practice**
    1. Requires synchronous network
       - Must distinguish "slow" from "crashed"
       - Real networks are asynchronous
    2. Network partition violates assumptions
       - Group A: Received PRE-COMMIT (will commit)
       - Group B: Did not receive PRE-COMMIT (will abort on timeout)
       - Partition heals → inconsistency!
    3. Latency: Additional phase = slower
    4. Complexity: More states to manage

  - **Conclusion: 3PC rarely deployed in practice. Modern systems use Paxos Commit or other consensus-based approaches.**

#### 7.1.2 Weighted Voting

- **Gifford's Quorum Voting (1979)**
  - **Generalization: Different Replicas Have Different Weights**
    - Basic Idea
      - Each replica has weight W_i
      - Total weight: W_total = Σ W_i
      - Read quorum: R (sum of weights)
      - Write quorum: W (sum of weights)
      - Constraint: R + W > W_total

- **Capacity-Based Weights**
  - Assign weights based on replica capacity
  - Example
    - Replica A: 10 GB storage, weight = 10
    - Replica B: 5 GB storage, weight = 5
    - Replica C: 2 GB storage, weight = 2
    - W_total = 17
    - Quorum options: R=9 W=9 (standard), R=5 W=13 (optimize reads), R=13 W=5 (optimize writes)
  - Benefits: Utilize heterogeneous hardware, proportional to capability
  - Challenges: Weight assignment policy, reconfiguration complexity

- **Geographic Weighting**
  - Assign weights based on latency/locality
  - Example
    - Application in US
    - US-East: weight = 3
    - US-West: weight = 2
    - EU: weight = 1
    - Asia: weight = 1
    - W_total = 7, R+W > 7
    - Config: R=4, W=4
      - Can get read quorum from US only (3+2=5 > 4)
      - Writes need at least one US + one overseas
  - Trade-offs: Lower latency for nearby clients, reduced availability, geographic failure correlation

- **Dynamic Adjustment**
  - Adjust weights based on observed behavior
  - DynamicWeighting class (Python Code)
    - Measure recent performance
    - Compute new weight based on latency and availability
    - Select quorum preferring high-weight replicas
    - Code example

- **Fairness Concerns**
  - Problem: Weighted voting can be unfair
  - Scenario
    - 5 replicas, equal weight
    - Replica A always in read quorum (by client preference)
    - Replica E rarely selected
    - Result: Replica A high load, Replica E underutilized
  - Solutions: Round-robin quorum selection, load-aware selection, penalize overloaded replicas

#### 7.1.3 Optimizations

- **Early Prepare**
  - Optimization: Prepare before final commit decision
  - Technique (Python Code)
    - execute_transaction
    - Execute locally
    - Start preparing participants ASAP (before client sees results)
    - Return results to client
    - async_prepare in background
    - Code example
  - Benefits: Overlaps computation with network I/O, reduces perceived latency
  - Risks: Might prepare unnecessarily, more complex failure handling

- **Presumed Abort**
  - Default assumption: Transactions abort unless proven otherwise
  - Implementation (Python Code)
    - PresumedAbortCoordinator class
    - If not all prepared: Don't log ABORT, don't send ABORT messages, participants timeout
    - Log PREPARED, then COMMIT
    - Recovery: No log entry → presume aborted
    - Code example
  - Benefits: Fewer log writes, faster abort path, less recovery overhead

- **Read-Only Optimization**
  - Participants with no writes don't need to prepare
  - Single-phase for read-only participants
  - Reduces coordination overhead

- **Tree-Structured 2PC**
  - Hierarchical coordinator tree
  - Root coordinator delegates to sub-coordinators
  - Reduces coordinator bottleneck
  - Used in distributed databases (e.g., X/Open XA)

### 7.2 Byzantine Fault Tolerance (1999-2025)

#### 7.2.1 PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)

- **Byzantine Generals Problem Recap**
  - Some processes are Byzantine (arbitrary behavior)
  - Must reach consensus despite malicious actors
  - Impossibility with ≤ 3f for f faults
  - Need 3f+1 processes to tolerate f Byzantine faults

- **PBFT Protocol (1999)**
  - **Castro and Liskov's Breakthrough**
    - First practical BFT algorithm
    - Efficient (not just theoretical)
    - Used in real systems

  - **Architecture**
    - Replicas: 3f+1 (e.g., 4 for f=1)
    - Clients send requests
    - Primary (leader) coordinates
    - Backups verify and vote
    - View changes on primary failure

  - **Normal Case Operation**
    - Phase 1: Request
      - Client → Primary: REQUEST
    - Phase 2: Pre-Prepare
      - Primary → All: PRE-PREPARE (sequence number, view, request)
    - Phase 3: Prepare
      - Backups → All: PREPARE (if PRE-PREPARE valid)
      - Wait for 2f+1 PREPARE (including own)
    - Phase 4: Commit
      - Replicas → All: COMMIT
      - Wait for 2f+1 COMMIT
      - Execute request
      - Send reply to client
    - Client waits for f+1 matching replies

  - **Why 2f+1 Quorums?**
    - Total replicas: 3f+1
    - Byzantine replicas: f
    - Correct replicas: 2f+1
    - Two quorums of 2f+1 must overlap in at least f+1 correct replicas
    - Ensures agreement

  - **View Change Protocol**
    - Triggered when primary suspected faulty
    - New view number
    - New primary (round-robin or deterministic)
    - Replicas send VIEW-CHANGE messages
    - New primary collects 2f+1 VIEW-CHANGE
    - Sends NEW-VIEW
    - Resume normal operation

  - **Checkpointing**
    - Periodic state snapshots
    - Garbage collection of old messages
    - Stable checkpoint: Agreed by 2f+1 replicas
    - Proof of correctness (checkpoint certificate)

  - **Cryptographic Requirements**
    - Message authentication (MACs or signatures)
    - Typically: MACs for performance
    - Signatures for view changes (avoid equivocation)
    - Merkle trees for efficiency

- **PBFT Code Example (Python)**
  - PBFTReplica class
  - State tracking (view, sequence number, log)
  - handle_request
  - handle_pre_prepare
  - handle_prepare
  - handle_commit
  - execute_request
  - Code example (simplified)

- **Performance Characteristics**
  - **Latency**
    - Best case: 3 message delays (PRE-PREPARE, PREPARE, COMMIT)
    - Worse than crash-fault-tolerant (Raft: 1-2 RTT)

  - **Throughput**
    - Original PBFT (1999): 1000s ops/sec
    - Modern implementations: 10,000s ops/sec
    - Limited by cryptographic operations

  - **Cost**
    - O(n²) messages per request (n = 3f+1)
    - Cryptographic overhead
    - More expensive than CFT

- **Limitations**
  - **Scalability**
    - O(n²) message complexity
    - Doesn't scale to large n
    - Typically n ≤ 10-20

  - **Network Assumptions**
    - Partially synchronous network
    - Bounded message delay (eventually)
    - Timeout tuning critical

  - **View Changes**
    - Expensive
    - Frequent view changes degrade performance
    - Need careful timeout tuning

#### 7.2.2 Modern BFT Protocols

- **HotStuff (2018)**
  - **Linear Communication Complexity**
    - PBFT: O(n²) messages
    - HotStuff: O(n) messages per view
    - Breakthrough for scalability

  - **Three-Phase Protocol**
    - Phase 1: Prepare
      - Leader proposes block
      - Replicas vote
    - Phase 2: Pre-Commit
      - Leader aggregates votes
      - Sends pre-commit certificate
      - Replicas vote
    - Phase 3: Commit
      - Leader aggregates votes
      - Sends commit certificate
      - Replicas vote
    - Phase 4: Decide
      - Leader sends decide message
      - Replicas execute

  - **Threshold Signatures**
    - Use threshold signatures to aggregate votes
    - O(1) size certificate
    - Reduces message size
    - Leader aggregates f+1 signatures → valid certificate

  - **Pipelining**
    - Multiple blocks in flight
    - Amortize view overhead
    - Higher throughput

  - **Performance**
    - 10x-100x higher throughput than PBFT
    - ~100,000 ops/sec demonstrated
    - Used in blockchain systems (LibraBFT, Diem)

    - Fast convergence

#### 7.2.3 BFT in Distributed Systems

- **Use Cases**
  - **Blockchain Consensus**
    - Permissioned blockchains (Hyperledger Fabric)
    - Proof-of-stake chains (Ethereum 2.0)
    - Public vs. permissioned

  - **Secure Multi-Party Computation**
    - Threshold cryptography
    - Secret sharing
    - Privacy-preserving protocols

  - **Critical Infrastructure**
    - Aviation systems
    - Financial systems
    - Medical devices
    - Where Byzantine faults possible (hardware errors, malware)

- **When BFT is Overkill**
  - Most datacenters: Crash faults, not Byzantine
  - Higher cost (3f+1 vs. 2f+1)
  - Lower performance
  - More complexity
  - Crash-fault-tolerant often sufficient

- **When BFT is Necessary**
  - Untrusted environments (blockchains)
  - Regulatory requirements (financial systems)
  - Adversarial settings (open internet)
  - Hardware errors (radiation, bitflips)
