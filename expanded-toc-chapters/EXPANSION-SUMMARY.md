2. **Production Focus**: Every concept grounded in real-world systems with metrics, costs, and failure scenarios

3. **Complete Code**: Runnable implementations, not pseudocode

4. **Evidence-Based**: Every guarantee requires evidence, with complete lifecycle tracking

5. **Learning Path**: Three-pass spiral ensures concepts build from intuition to mastery

## Next Steps

To complete the remaining chapters (7-21):
1. Continue applying the ChapterCraftingGuide framework
2. Maintain consistency with established patterns
3. Integrate content from existing /home/deepak/buk/chapters/ files
4. Ensure cross-chapter references and threads
5. Complete with comprehensive appendices

The foundation is now solid with Chapters 1-6 providing the theoretical and practical groundwork for understanding distributed systems. The remaining chapters will build on this foundation to cover modern architectures, planet-scale systems, practical implementation, and future directions.
