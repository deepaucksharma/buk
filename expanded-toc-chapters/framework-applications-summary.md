## Chapter 2: Time, Order, and Causality

### Primary Invariant: ORDER
**Happened-before relationships preserved across distributed nodes**

#### Invariant Hierarchy
1. **Fundamental**: ORDER, MONOTONICITY
2. **Derived**: CAUSALITY, BOUNDED DIVERGENCE
3. **Composite**: FRESHNESS, EXTERNAL CONSISTENCY

#### Evidence Lifecycle
- **Generation**: Physical clocks (TSC, NTP), Logical timestamps (Lamport, Vector), Hybrid (HLC), Intervals (TrueTime)
- **Validation**: Monotonicity checks, causality verification, uncertainty bounds
- **Active**: Transaction ordering, event sequencing, staleness checks
- **Expiration**: Clock sync age, lease timeouts, CT staleness
- **Renewal/Revocation**: Resync, lease renewal, epoch increment

#### 15 Key Insights
1. "Now" is a local illusion
2. Clocks measure intervals, not instants
3. Causality is more fundamental than time
4. Coordination budget: time sync has cost
5. Evidence expiration drives mode transitions
6. Logical clocks: causality without synchronization
7. Hybrid clocks: best of both worlds
8. Uncertainty intervals: making ignorance explicit
9. Closed timestamps: safe points for reading
10. Commit wait: trading latency for consistency
11. Time evidence is non-transitive
12. Monotonicity violations break everything
13. Different clocks compose via weakest guarantee
14. Timestamp skew causes resurrection bugs
15. Geo-replication: physics dominates design

#### 10 Essential Diagrams
1. Invariant Guardian (Time Edition)
2. Evidence Lifecycle (Temporal Proofs)
3. Clock Type Comparison Matrix
4. Composition Ladder (Time Guarantees)
5. Mode Compass (Time System States)
6. NTP Synchronization Flow
7. Vector Clock Causality Detection
8. HLC Update Rules
9. TrueTime Commit Wait
10. Closed Timestamp Protocol

#### Mode Matrix
- **Floor**: Causality only (logical clocks)
- **Target**: Bounded skew, fresh reads, HLC + CT
- **Degraded**: Larger uncertainty, expired leases, eventual
- **Recovery**: New epoch, resync, rebuild evidence

#### Learning Spiral
- **Pass 1**: Distributed log out-of-order events, need for causality
- **Pass 2**: Clock mechanisms (Lamport, Vector, HLC, TrueTime), trade-offs
- **Pass 3**: Composition across regions, mode transitions, debugging with temporal evidence

## Chapter 3: Consensus

### Primary Invariant: UNIQUENESS
**At most one decision per consensus instance**

#### Invariant Hierarchy

1. **Fundamental Invariants**
   - **UNIQUENESS**: At most one value chosen per instance
     - Threat model: Split brain, network partition, concurrent proposers
     - Protection boundary: Quorum intersection, proposal numbering
     - Evidence needed: Quorum certificates (2f+1 votes), leader leases
     - Degradation semantics: Safe → No progress (never violate safety)
     - Repair pattern: Leader election, view change, replay log

   - **AGREEMENT**: All correct nodes decide the same value
     - Builds on: UNIQUENESS (if decided, all agree)
     - Evidence: Accept certificates from majority
     - Protection: Quorum overlap ensures consistency

2. **Derived Invariants**
   - **VALIDITY**: Decided value was proposed by some node
     - Builds on: UNIQUENESS + AGREEMENT
     - Evidence: Proposer ID in quorum certificate
     - Protection: Only accept legitimate proposals

   - **TOTAL ORDER**: Sequence of decisions forms consistent log
     - Builds on: UNIQUENESS per slot + Multi-instance consensus
     - Evidence: Log indices + commit certificates
     - Protection: Per-slot consensus + log ordering

3. **Composite Invariants**
   - **LINEARIZABILITY**: Operations appear atomic, respecting real-time order
     - Components: TOTAL ORDER + UNIQUENESS + Real-time constraints
     - Evidence: Quorum certificates + lease-based single-writer
     - User promise: "System behaves like single correct copy"
     - Implementation: Raft, Multi-Paxos with leases

   - **BYZANTINE TOLERANCE**: Agreement despite arbitrary failures
     - Components: UNIQUENESS + AGREEMENT + 3f+1 nodes + Signatures
     - Evidence: 2f+1 signed certificates per phase
     - User promise: "Tolerates f malicious nodes among 3f+1"
     - Implementation: PBFT, Tendermint, HotStuff

#### Evidence Lifecycle for Consensus

1. **Generation Phase**
   - **Proposal Numbers**: Monotonically increasing, globally unique
     - Format: (round, node_id) ensures total order
     - Scope: Per-consensus instance
     - Binding: Proposer identity
     - Cost: Local counter increment

   - **Promise Certificates**: Phase 1 quorum responses
     - Content: "I promise not to accept lower proposals"
     - Scope: Per-proposal-number
     - Lifetime: Until higher proposal seen
     - Evidence: Majority promise responses

   - **Accept Certificates**: Phase 2 quorum confirmations
     - Content: "I accept this value"
     - Scope: Per-proposal + value
     - Lifetime: Until decision committed
     - Evidence: Majority accept responses

   - **Commit Certificates**: Decision proof
     - Content: "Value chosen with proof"
     - Scope: Per-instance, immutable
     - Lifetime: Permanent (or until log truncation)
     - Evidence: Quorum accept certificate

   - **Leader Leases**: Temporary exclusive proposer rights
     - Content: "I am leader for instances [N, N+K] until time T"
     - Scope: Range of instances, time-bounded
     - Lifetime: Lease duration (typically 5-30s)
     - Evidence: Lease certificate from majority
     - Optimization: Amortizes Phase 1 across multiple instances

2. **Validation Phase**
   - **Proposal Number Checking**: n_new > n_promised
   - **Quorum Verification**: Count >= ⌈(N+1)/2⌉ or 2f+1 for Byzantine
   - **Signature Validation**: For Byzantine protocols, verify all signatures
   - **Lease Validity**: Check expiry timestamp vs current time
   - **View/Term Monotonicity**: New view > old view

3. **Active Phase**
   - **Decision Making**: Using commit certificates to apply operations
   - **Log Replication**: Propagating committed values to followers
   - **State Machine Execution**: Applying decided commands in order
   - **Read Serving**: Using lease for linearizable reads
   - **Evidence Propagation**: Broadcasting decisions to learners

4. **Expiration Phase**
   - **Lease Expiration**: Leader must renew or step down
   - **View/Term Timeout**: Triggers leader election
   - **Proposal Timeout**: Retry with higher proposal number
   - **Heartbeat Timeout**: Follower initiates election

5. **Renewal/Revocation Phase**
   - **Lease Renewal**: Leader re-acquires majority promises
   - **View Change**: New leader election after timeout
   - **Proposal Retry**: Higher proposal number after rejection
   - **Configuration Change**: Joint consensus for membership

#### 15 Key Insights for Consensus

**Foundational (1-5)**:
1. **Quorums Create Truth Through Intersection**
   - Any two majorities must overlap in at least one node
   - Implication: Overlapping node prevents conflicting decisions
   - Evidence: Pigeonhole principle, quorum math
   - Transfer: Applies to any voting-based system

2. **Proposal Numbers Establish Temporal Order**
   - Monotonically increasing numbers create total order
   - Implication: Higher proposal wins, lower rejected
   - Evidence: Paxos/Raft proposal numbering scheme
   - Transfer: Sequence numbers, generation numbers, epochs

3. **Phases Ensure Safety, Not Liveness**
   - Multi-phase protocols guarantee "never wrong," not "always complete"
   - Implication: Can always wait forever; timeout heuristics for liveness
   - Evidence: FLP impossibility, eventual synchrony assumption
   - Transfer: Safety vs liveness trade-off in any distributed protocol

4. **Leaders Optimize, Don't Define Correctness**
   - Leader is performance optimization, not safety requirement
   - Implication: Leaderless possible (EPaxos), but leader makes efficient
   - Evidence: Basic Paxos has no stable leader, Multi-Paxos optimizes with one
   - Transfer: Centralization for efficiency, not correctness

5. **Byzantine Changes Everything: 3f+1 and Signatures**
   - Arbitrary failures require 3f+1 nodes (vs 2f+1 for crash)
   - Implication: Higher replication cost, cryptographic overhead
   - Evidence: Byzantine Generals lower bound
   - Transfer: Malicious actors require different assumptions everywhere

**Mechanism Insights (6-10)**:
6. **Two Phases Prevent Conflicting Choices**
   - Phase 1: Learn any prior decisions (prepare/promise)
   - Phase 2: Propose knowing history (accept/commit)
   - Implication: Must honor past commitments
   - Transfer: Two-phase protocols common (2PC, handshakes)

7. **Leader Leases Amortize Coordination**
   - Stable leader skips Phase 1 for multiple instances
   - Implication: Reduces latency from 4 RTTs to 2 RTTs
   - Cost: Lease management overhead, failover delay
   - Evidence: Multi-Paxos, Raft leadership

8. **Quorum Flexibility: Intersection Suffices**
   - Don't need majorities; any intersecting sets work
   - Implication: Can optimize for read-heavy or write-heavy
   - Evidence: Flexible Paxos, grid quorums
   - Transfer: Workload-optimized quorum systems

9. **Log as Consensus Sequence**
   - Replicated log = sequence of consensus instances
   - Implication: Each slot independent consensus, ordered execution
   - Evidence: Raft log, Paxos log, blockchain
   - Transfer: Append-only logs for auditability

10. **Byzantine Requires Signed Evidence**
    - Signatures prevent equivocation, enable proof
    - Implication: Crypto overhead, but reduces message complexity (O(n²) → O(n) with threshold sigs)
    - Evidence: PBFT signatures, HotStuff threshold signatures
    - Transfer: Any untrusted environment needs cryptographic proofs

**Composition and Operational (11-15)**:
11. **Consensus Evidence Is Per-Instance, Non-Transitive**
    - Commit certificate for slot N doesn't validate slot M
    - Implication: Must re-run consensus for each decision
    - Solution: Multi-instance with log replication
    - Transfer: Per-operation validation in security systems

12. **View Changes Are Expensive Recovery Operations**
    - Leader election involves multiple rounds, state transfer
    - Implication: Optimize for leader stability, not frequent elections
    - Evidence: Raft randomized timeouts, pre-vote optimization
    - Transfer: Leader stability important in any coordinated system

13. **Composition Via Nested Consensus**
    - Use consensus to agree on consensus configuration
    - Implication: Joint consensus for membership changes
    - Evidence: Raft configuration changes, Paxos reconfiguration
    - Transfer: Bootstrapping problem requires meta-level agreement

14. **Sharding Multiplies Consensus Groups**
    - Each shard runs independent consensus instance
    - Implication: Scales throughput, but cross-shard needs 2PC
    - Evidence: Spanner millions of Paxos groups, CockroachDB ranges
    - Transfer: Partition to scale, coordinate to maintain consistency

15. **Consensus Doesn't Guarantee Durability**
    - Decision chosen ≠ decision persisted to disk
    - Implication: Must sync to disk before acknowledging
    - Evidence: Raft log must be durable, Paxos acceptor state
    - Transfer: Separate consensus from durability mechanism

3. **Quorum Intersection Proof**
```
Universe of N=5 nodes: {A, B, C, D, E}

Quorum Q1 = {A, B, C}  (size 3)
Quorum Q2 = {C, D, E}  (size 3)

Intersection: Q1 ∩ Q2 = {C} (non-empty!)

Node C prevents conflicting decisions:
- If Q1 chooses value X, C knows X
- Q2 cannot choose Y≠X without C's participation
- C rejects Y because it accepted X
```

```
Traditional:  Q1 = ⌈(N+1)/2⌉, Q2 = ⌈(N+1)/2⌉
              N=5: Q1=3, Q2=3

Fast Reads:   Q1 = N (all), Q2 = 1 (any)
              Phase 1 expensive, reads cheap

Grid Quorum:  N=9 in 3x3 grid
              Q1 = any row (3 nodes)
              Q2 = any column (3 nodes)
              Intersection guaranteed

Property: Every Q1 intersects every Q2

#### Learning Spiral for Consensus

**Pass 1: Intuition**
- Story: The distributed lock that was held by two clients simultaneously
- Problem: Both clients think they have exclusive access
- Invariant at risk: UNIQUENESS (at most one lock holder)
- Simple fix: Majority voting before granting lock
- Evidence needed: Proof that majority agreed

**Pass 2: Understanding**
- Why simple majority vote isn't enough: Network partition creates two majorities
- Paxos solution: Two phases with proposal numbers
  - Phase 1: "Anyone else decide?" (prepare/promise)
  - Phase 2: "Let's decide this" (accept/commit)
- Trade-offs:
  - Safety always (never wrong) vs Liveness eventually (might block)
  - Leader lease (fast path) vs Full protocol (always safe)
  - Crash tolerance (2f+1) vs Byzantine (3f+1)

**Pass 3: Mastery**
- Composition: Multi-Paxos builds replicated log from per-slot consensus

## Chapter 4: Replication

### Primary Invariant: AVAILABILITY
**System remains operational despite failures**

#### Invariant Hierarchy

1. **Fundamental Invariants**
   - **AVAILABILITY**: System responds to requests despite failures
     - Threat model: Node crashes, network partitions, correlated failures
     - Protection boundary: Multiple replicas, geographic distribution
     - Evidence needed: Replication certificates, quorum acknowledgments
     - Degradation semantics: Strong consistency → Eventual consistency
     - Repair pattern: Replica rebuild, anti-entropy, read repair

   - **DURABILITY**: Acknowledged writes survive failures
     - Threat model: Disk failures, node crashes, data corruption
     - Protection boundary: Replication factor, persistent storage
     - Evidence needed: Write confirmations from quorum
     - Degradation semantics: Synchronous → Async → Lost updates
     - Repair pattern: Backup restore, replica rebuild, log replay

2. **Derived Invariants**
   - **CONSISTENCY**: Replicas eventually agree (or continuously agree)
     - Builds on: AVAILABILITY + DURABILITY + Synchronization
     - Evidence: Version vectors, timestamps, consensus
     - Protection: Replication protocols (primary-backup, multi-master, quorum)
     - Spectrum: Strong → Causal → Eventual

3. **Composite Invariants**
   - **BOUNDED STALENESS**: Replicas within δ of leader
     - Components: CONSISTENCY + Time bound + Evidence
     - Evidence: Closed timestamps, replication lag metrics
     - User promise: "Reads at most δ seconds stale"
     - Implementation: Follower reads with CT

   - **READ-YOUR-WRITES**: Client sees own updates
     - Components: CONSISTENCY + Session tracking
     - Evidence: Session tokens, causal metadata
     - User promise: "Your writes visible to your reads"
     - Implementation: Session guarantees, sticky routing

#### Evidence Lifecycle for Replication

1. **Generation Phase**
   - **Write Confirmations**: Acknowledgments from replicas
   - **Version Vectors**: Causal history per replica
   - **Replication Positions**: LSN, binlog position, commit index
   - **Quorum Certificates**: N-R-W quorum proofs
   - **Tombstones**: Deletion markers with TTL

2. **Validation Phase**
   - **Version Comparison**: Vector clock happens-before checks
   - **Quorum Counting**: R + W > N for consistency
   - **Causality Checking**: Dependency satisfaction
   - **Conflict Detection**: Concurrent update identification
   - **Freshness Validation**: Replication lag vs SLO

3. **Active Phase**
   - **Serving Reads**: From replicas with evidence
   - **Propagating Writes**: Replication streams
   - **Conflict Resolution**: LWW, CRDT merge, custom logic
   - **Anti-Entropy**: Merkle tree comparison, sync
   - **Cache Invalidation**: Consistency maintenance

4. **Expiration Phase**
   - **Version Vector Pruning**: GC old entries
   - **Tombstone Cleanup**: After TTL expiry
   - **Hint Timeout**: Hinted handoff expiration
   - **Cache TTL**: Freshness-based expiry
   - **Replication Lag SLO**: Alert on staleness

5. **Renewal/Revocation Phase**
   - **Primary Election**: New primary after failure
   - **Replica Rebuild**: Full resync from primary
   - **Anti-Entropy Cycle**: Periodic consistency repair
   - **Evidence Rebinding**: New epoch, new configuration

#### 15 Key Insights for Replication

**Foundational (1-5)**:
1. **CAP Theorem: Choose Two of Three**
   - Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
   - Implication: During partition, choose C or A
   - Evidence: Formal proof, real-world systems
   - Transfer: Fundamental trade-off in distributed systems

2. **Replication Factor: N Copies, f Failures Tolerated**
   - N replicas tolerate N-1 failures (but not all combinations)
   - Implication: Higher N → Higher availability, higher cost
   - Evidence: Combinatorics, failure probability math
   - Transfer: Redundancy everywhere (RAID, backup, multi-region)

3. **Synchronous vs Async: Durability vs Latency**
   - Sync: Wait for replicas (slow, durable)
   - Async: Return immediately (fast, risk data loss)
   - Implication: Explicit trade-off, no free lunch
   - Evidence: Production latency vs data loss measurements
   - Transfer: Every write system faces this choice

4. **Conflicts Are Inevitable in Multi-Master**
   - Multiple writers → concurrent updates → conflicts
   - Implication: Must have conflict resolution strategy
   - Evidence: Vector clock divergence, concurrent versions
   - Transfer: Collaborative editing, distributed caches

5. **Eventual Consistency: Availability First**
   - Accept temporary inconsistency for availability
   - Implication: Application must handle stale reads, conflicts
   - Evidence: Dynamo, Cassandra, eventually converge
   - Transfer: DNS, CDNs, any geo-distributed system

**Mechanism Insights (6-10)**:
6. **Primary-Backup: Simplicity Through Single Writer**
   - One primary handles writes, replicates to backups
   - Implication: Simple, strong consistency, single point of write bottleneck
   - Evidence: MySQL replication, PostgreSQL streaming
   - Transfer: Leader-follower pattern common

7. **Quorum Systems: Tunable Consistency**
   - Read quorum R, Write quorum W, N replicas
   - Property: R + W > N ensures consistency
   - Implication: Can optimize for read-heavy or write-heavy
   - Evidence: Dynamo N-R-W, Cassandra tunable consistency
   - Transfer: Voting systems, distributed consensus

8. **CRDTs: Conflict-Free by Design**
   - Commutative, associative operations → automatic convergence
   - Implication: No coordination needed, eventual consistency guaranteed
   - Evidence: G-Counter, OR-Set, production use in Riak/Redis
   - Transfer: Merge-friendly data structures everywhere

9. **Anti-Entropy: Continuous Repair**
   - Proactive synchronization, not just on-demand
   - Implication: Eventual consistency guaranteed, background overhead
   - Evidence: Merkle trees, Gossip protocols
   - Transfer: Backup verification, data integrity checks

10. **Last-Writer-Wins: Simple But Dangerous**
    - Use timestamp to pick winner in conflict
    - Implication: Silently loses writes, resurrection bugs
    - Evidence: Production outages, deleted data reappearing
    - Transfer: Beware simplistic conflict resolution

**Composition and Operational (11-15)**:
11. **Replication Evidence Is Transitive for Causality**
    - Version vectors carry causal history across boundaries
    - Implication: Can propagate causal consistency transitively
    - Solution: Session guarantees, causal metadata
    - Transfer: Provenance tracking, audit trails

12. **Geo-Replication: Latency Budget Exhausted**
    - Cross-region latency (50-250ms) dominates
    - Implication: Async replication almost always, bounded staleness
    - Evidence: Speed of light, production measurements
    - Transfer: Global distributed systems must accept eventual

13. **Replication Lag: The Invisible Debt**
    - Lag accumulates silently, violates SLOs unexpectedly
    - Implication: Must monitor and alert on lag metrics
    - Evidence: Seconds_Behind_Master, CT lag
    - Transfer: Any async process needs lag monitoring

14. **Primary Failover: Complexity Explosion**
    - Detecting failure, electing new primary, promoting, redirecting
    - Implication: Test failover regularly, automate carefully
    - Evidence: Production incidents during failover
    - Transfer: Leader election complexity in any system

15. **Consistency Levels Compose Downward**
    - Strong → Causal → Eventual, never upward without evidence
    - Implication: End-to-end consistency = weakest link
    - Solution: Explicit evidence upgrades or accept degradation
    - Transfer: Security levels, QoS composition

#### Mode Matrix for Replication
(Similar structure to Chapters 2 and 3, adapted for replication-specific modes)

#### Learning Spiral for Replication

**Pass 1: Intuition**
- Story: The database that went down, taking the entire service with it
- Problem: Single point of failure
- Invariant at risk: AVAILABILITY
- Simple fix: Make a copy on another machine
- Evidence needed: Confirmation that copy is up-to-date

**Pass 2: Understanding**
- Why simple copying isn't enough: Consistency vs availability trade-off
- Solutions:
  - Primary-backup: Simple, but single writer bottleneck
  - Multi-master: High availability, but conflicts
  - Quorum: Tunable trade-off
- Trade-offs: Sync (slow, durable) vs Async (fast, risky)

**Pass 3: Mastery**
- Composition: Geo-replication with causal consistency
- Cross-shard: Distributed transactions across replicas
- Operational:
  - Monitor: Replication lag, conflict rate, failover time
  - Debug: Trace version vectors, conflict resolution
  - Degrade: Accept stale reads, async replication
