#### 16.2.3 Queueing Analysis
- **Little's Law Application**
  - Formula: L = λ * W
    - L = average number of requests in system
    - λ = average arrival rate (requests/sec)
    - W = average time in system (seconds)
  - Capacity planning
    - Target latency (W) and throughput (λ)
    - Calculate required concurrency (L)
    - Size thread pools, connection pools
  - Bottleneck identification
    - Observing L, λ, W in production
    - Detecting deviations from Little's Law
    - Queueing delays vs service time

- **Kingman's Formula**
  - Approximating queue wait time
    - ρ = utilization (λ / μ)
    - μ = service rate (requests/sec)
    - c² = coefficient of variation (variance/mean²)
  - Queue wait time formula
    - W_q = (ρ / (1 - ρ)) * (c_a² + c_s²) / 2 * W_s
    - c_a² = arrival process variability
    - c_s² = service process variability
    - W_s = average service time
  - Implications
    - High utilization (ρ → 1) → unbounded wait time
    - Keep utilization < 70-80% for predictable latency
    - Variability amplifies queueing delays

- **Tail Amplification**
  - Fanout queries
    - Querying N backends in parallel
    - Overall latency = max(backend latencies)
    - Tail latency dominates
  - Probability of tail event
    - P(max > X) = 1 - (1 - P(one > X))^N
    - Example: p99 = 100ms, N = 100 backends
      - P(max > 100ms) = 1 - (0.99)^100 = 63%
  - Mitigation strategies
    - Hedged requests (backup requests)
    - Speculative execution
    - Canary requests (test one backend first)
    - Reducing per-backend tail latency

- **Series Queue Effects**
  - Multiple queues in series (e.g., load balancer → app server → database)
    - Latency = sum of individual latencies
    - Variance adds up
  - Variability amplification
    - Downstream queues see bursty arrivals
    - Higher variance → higher queueing delays
  - Load balancing to reduce variance
    - Consistent hashing for cache affinity
    - Least-connections load balancing
    - Power of two choices
