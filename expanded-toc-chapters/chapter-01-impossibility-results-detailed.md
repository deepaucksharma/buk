Supporting: UNIQUENESS (at most one leader), ORDER (happened-before)

UNCERTAINTY ADDRESSED
Cannot know: Global state instantly, message arrival time, failure vs delay
Cost to know: Network round-trips, timeout intervals, quorum coordination
Acceptable doubt: Eventual detection, bounded disagreement window

EVIDENCE GENERATED
Type(s): Failure detectors, quorum certificates, impossibility proofs
Scope: System-wide   Lifetime: Configuration epoch
Binding: Protocol participants   Transitivity: Non-transitive
Revocation: Epoch change, reconfiguration

GUARANTEE VECTOR
Input G: ⟨Global, None, Fractured, EO, None, Unauth⟩

## Part 1.1: The FLP Impossibility (1985) - The Foundation

### 1.1.1 The Fundamental Trade-off
#### 1.1.1.1 Statement of the Impossibility
- **The Precise Formulation**
  - No deterministic protocol solves consensus in asynchronous systems
  - Even with one crash failure
  - Evidence type: Mathematical proof (reduction to contradiction)
  - Invariant protected: AGREEMENT (all decide same value)

#### 1.1.1.2 The Asynchronous Model
- **What "Asynchronous" Really Means**
  - No upper bound on message delay
  - No synchronized clocks
  - Cannot distinguish slow from crashed
  - Evidence lifecycle: None (fundamental uncertainty)
  - Context capsule: {invariant: DETECTION, evidence: NONE, boundary: global, mode: floor, fallback: timeout}

#### 1.1.1.3 The Critical Configuration
- **The Bivalent State Construction**
  - Initial configuration: undecided
  - 0-valent: will decide 0
  - 1-valent: will decide 1
  - Bivalent: both outcomes possible
  - Evidence: State reachability graph
  - Mode: Theoretical (no practical system)

### 1.1.2 Mathematical Proof Structure and Implications
#### 1.1.2.1 The Proof by Contradiction
- **Step 1: Initial Bivalence**
  - Some initial configuration must be bivalent
  - Adjacent configurations differ by one process
  - Evidence: Combinatorial argument
  - Guarantee vector: ⟨Global, None, Fractured, None, None, None⟩

#### 1.1.2.2 The Forever Bivalent Execution
- **Step 2: Maintaining Bivalence**
  - From any bivalent configuration
  - Adversary can force another bivalent configuration
  - Critical process and message ordering
  - Evidence type: Adversarial scheduler
  - Lifetime: Infinite (no termination)

#### 1.1.2.3 The Diagonalization Argument
- **Step 3: The Infinite Execution**
  - Construct infinite non-deciding execution
  - Fair to all processes
  - All messages eventually delivered
  - Violates termination (liveness)
  - Context capsule: {invariant: TERMINATION, evidence: IMPOSSIBLE, mode: floor}

### 1.1.3 Production Impact: Why Your Database Can Hang
#### 1.1.3.1 Real-World Manifestations
- **MongoDB Primary Election Stalls (2019)**
  - 47-second stall during network partition
  - Cost: $2.3M in lost transactions
  - Root cause: FLP impossibility in practice
  - Evidence: Election timeout expired
  - Mode transition: Target → Degraded (47 seconds)

#### 1.1.3.2 Circumventing FLP: Practical Solutions
- **Failure Detectors**
  - Eventually perfect (◇P): Eventually stops suspecting correct processes
  - Eventually strong (◇S): Eventually agrees on failures
  - Implementation: Heartbeats with increasing timeout
  - Evidence generated: Suspicion list with epoch
  - Guarantee upgrade: EO → BS(δ) with timeout bound

#### 1.1.3.3 Randomization: Breaking Symmetry
- **Ben-Or's Algorithm**
  - Expected finite termination
  - Probability 1 termination
  - Coin flip breaks ties
  - Evidence: Random bits with commitment
  - Path typing: Deterministic safety + Probabilistic liveness

#### 1.1.3.4 Partial Synchrony: The Middle Ground
- **Dwork, Lynch, Stockmeyer (DLS) Model**
  - Unknown bound on message delay
  - Bound holds eventually
  - GST (Global Stabilization Time)
  - Evidence: Sufficient timeout reached
  - Mode: Recovery → Target after GST

- **Brewer's Keynote Formulation**
  - Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
  - Pick two of three
  - Informal but influential
  - Evidence: Empirical observation
  - No formal invariant definition

#### 1.2.1.2 The Formal Proof (2002)
- **Gilbert and Lynch Formalization**
  - Consistency: Linearizability
  - Availability: Every request receives response
  - Partition tolerance: System continues despite network partition
  - Evidence: Impossibility proof via contradiction
  - Invariant hierarchy: CONSISTENCY vs AVAILABILITY

#### 1.2.1.3 The Precise Definitions Matter
- **Consistency as Linearizability**
  - Real-time ordering respected
  - Single-copy semantics
  - Evidence required: Total order broadcast
  - Guarantee vector: ⟨Global, SS, SER, Fresh(φ), None, Auth⟩

### 1.2.2 The 12-Year Misunderstanding
#### 1.2.2.1 Common Misconceptions
- **"Pick Two" Misinterpretation**
  - Networks partition (not a choice)
  - Real choice: C or A during partition
  - Evidence during partition: Stale or none
  - Mode during partition: CP=unavailable, AP=inconsistent

#### 1.2.2.2 The Spectrum of Consistency
- **Not Binary but Continuous**
  - Strong consistency (linearizability)

#### 1.2.2.3 The PACELC Extension
- **Partition and Else**
  - IF Partition THEN Consistency OR Availability
  - ELSE Latency OR Consistency
  - Normal operation trade-offs matter
  - Evidence: Coordination cost in common case
  - Dualities: Latency ↔ Consistency even without partition

### 1.2.3 CAP in Practice: AWS DynamoDB vs Google Spanner
#### 1.2.3.1 DynamoDB: AP System Design

  - Guarantee: ⟨Global, SS, SER, Fresh(TT), Idem, Auth⟩
  - Mode matrix: Floor mode preserves consistency

#### 1.2.3.3 Hybrid Approaches: Azure Cosmos DB
- **Tunable Consistency Levels**
  - Five consistency levels
  - Per-request configuration
  - Explicit trade-off control
  - Evidence varies by level

  - Partition: Consistent but unavailable
  - Evidence generation mode-dependent

#### 1.3.2.3 PA/EC Systems (Rare Combination)
- **Examples: Few production systems**
  - Partition: Choose availability
  - Else: Choose consistency
  - Philosophical contradiction
  - Why consistent normally but not under partition?

#### 1.3.2.4 PA/EL Systems (Availability Preference)
- **Examples: Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak**
  - Partition: Choose availability
  - Else: Choose latency
  - Always available, sometimes inconsistent
  - Evidence: Best-effort, may be stale
  - Production metrics: 99.999% available

### 1.3.3 Economic Implications of Consistency Choices

  - Strong consistency: +10-100ms latency
  - Additional network round-trips
  - Cross-region coordination: +50-200ms
  - Evidence generation overhead
  - Cost model: Latency × Request Rate × Revenue/Request

#### 1.3.3.2 Business Impact Analysis
- **Revenue vs Correctness**
  - E-commerce: Availability > Consistency (shopping cart)
  - Banking: Consistency > Availability (account balance)
  - Social media: Latency > Consistency (likes)
  - Evidence requirements vary by domain
  - Context capsule: Business invariants

#### 1.3.3.3 SLA Implications

## Chapter Summary

### The Irreducible Truth
**"Distributed systems cannot simultaneously guarantee consistency, availability, and partition tolerance—physics forces us to choose, and these impossibilities define every design decision we make."**

### Key Mental Models
1. **Impossibilities as Guardrails**: FLP, CAP, and PACELC aren't obstacles but guide rails that shape correct designs
2. **Evidence Has Cost**: Every guarantee requires evidence, evidence requires communication, communication requires time
3. **Explicit Degradation**: Systems must explicitly choose their failure modes and make trade-offs visible
4. **Network Reality**: The physical network imposes fundamental constraints that no protocol can overcome
5. **Composition Awareness**: Guarantees degrade at boundaries unless explicitly maintained with evidence

### What's Next
Chapter 2 will explore how we model and manage time in distributed systems, building on these impossibility results to understand why global time cannot exist and how we create useful approximations through logical clocks, vector clocks, and hybrid approaches.
