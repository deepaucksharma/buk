# Chapter 3: Consensus - The Heart of Distributed Systems
## Complete ChapterCraftingGuide Framework Application

---

## 1. COMPLETE INVARIANT HIERARCHY

### Primary Invariant: UNIQUENESS
**Definition**: At most one value can be chosen for any consensus instance.

**Threat Model**:
- Split brain scenarios where multiple leaders claim authority
- Concurrent proposals with different values
- Network partitions allowing divergent decisions
- Message replay attacks attempting to resurrect old decisions
- Byzantine nodes proposing multiple conflicting values

**Protection Boundary**:
- Service level: Single Paxos group or Raft cluster
- Shard level: Per-shard consensus in partitioned systems
- Region level: Within datacenter for fast local decisions

**Evidence Needed**:
- Quorum certificates (2f+1 promises/votes)
- Leader lease tokens with epoch numbers
- Commit certificates with replica signatures
- Term/view numbers for leader uniqueness
- Proposal numbers for total ordering

**Degradation Semantics**:
- During election: No progress but safety maintained (no conflicting decisions)
- During partition: Minority side cannot make decisions
- During recovery: Must learn committed values before proposing new ones
- Minimum acceptable truth: Never return two different committed values

**Repair Pattern**:
- Re-elect: Establish new leader with higher term/view
- Re-prove: Verify existing decisions through quorum queries
- Reconcile: Learn committed but unexecuted instances
- Reissue: Generate fresh certificates with new epoch
- Compensate: Not applicable (consensus cannot be reversed)

---

### Supporting Invariant: AGREEMENT
**Definition**: All correct nodes that decide must decide the same value.

**Threat Model**:
- Asymmetric network partitions (node A sees B but B doesn't see A)
- Message loss causing incomplete quorum views
- Timing differences leading to stale reads
- Replica lag causing divergent views

**Protection Boundary**: Quorum intersection
**Evidence**: Overlapping majorities guarantee information flow
**Degradation**: Temporary disagreement during leadership transition
**Repair**: Catch-up protocol, state transfer

---

### Supporting Invariant: VALIDITY
**Definition**: Any value decided must have been proposed by some participant.

**Threat Model**:
- Byzantine corruption of values in transit
- Memory corruption on acceptors
- Malicious injection of arbitrary values

**Protection Boundary**: Cryptographic signatures, authenticated channels
**Evidence**: Digital signatures on proposals, MAC on messages
**Degradation**: Reject unverifiable proposals
**Repair**: Re-request from original proposer

---

### Supporting Invariant: TERMINATION (Liveness)
**Definition**: Eventually, some correct node decides.

**Threat Model**:
- Perpetual leader churn preventing progress
- Infinite message delays
- Dueling proposers in classic livelock

**Protection Boundary**: Eventually synchronous assumptions, leader leases
**Evidence**: Timeout expiration, heartbeat absence
**Degradation**: No progress but correctness maintained
**Repair**: Backoff strategies, randomized timeouts, stable leader election

---

### Derived Invariant: TOTAL ORDER
**Definition**: All decisions form a consistent sequence across all nodes.

**Built From**: UNIQUENESS (per slot) + AGREEMENT (on each value)
**Protection**: Log sequence numbers, Paxos instance IDs
**Evidence**: Consecutive commit certificates
**Composition**: Enables replicated state machines

---

### Derived Invariant: LEADER UNIQUENESS
**Definition**: At most one leader per term/view.

**Built From**: UNIQUENESS applied to leader election
**Protection**: Vote exactly once per term, majority needed
**Evidence**: Election certificates with term numbers
**Degradation**: Multiple candidates okay, multiple leaders forbidden

## 2. EVIDENCE LIFECYCLE FOR CONSENSUS PROTOCOLS

### State Machine
```
PROPOSED → PREPARED → ACCEPTED → COMMITTED → EXECUTED → ARCHIVED
   ↓          ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓          ↓
 [none]   [promises]  [accepts]   [commit     [state     [compacted]
                                   cert]      change]
```

### Evidence Types by Protocol

#### Paxos Evidence
**Promise Certificate**
- Scope: Single Paxos instance for proposal number N
- Lifetime: Until higher proposal seen or instance committed
- Binding: Acceptor identity + instance ID
- Transitivity: Non-transitive (each acceptor independent)
- Revocation: Higher prepare request
- Cost: O(n) messages to generate, O(1) to verify

**Accept Certificate**
- Scope: Value chosen for instance I
- Lifetime: Permanent (consensus is final)
- Binding: Instance ID + accepted value
- Transitivity: Transitive (if 2f+1 accept, all can trust)
- Revocation: Cannot be revoked (immutable decision)
- Cost: O(n) messages, verifiable with quorum count

#### Raft Evidence
**Vote Certificate**
- Scope: Term T leadership
- Lifetime: Until term ends or new leader elected
- Binding: Candidate ID + term number
- Transitivity: Non-transitive per voter
- Revocation: Higher term announcement
- Cost: O(n) for election

**Commit Index Proof**
- Scope: Log prefix up to index I
- Lifetime: Permanent for committed entries
- Binding: Leader term + log index
- Transitivity: Yes (followers trust leader's commit index)
- Revocation: Never (committed = immutable)
- Cost: Piggybacked on heartbeats (essentially free)

#### Byzantine (PBFT/HotStuff) Evidence
**Prepare Certificate (PBFT)**
- Scope: View V, sequence S, digest D
- Lifetime: View duration
- Binding: 2f+1 prepare signatures
- Transitivity: Yes (certificate is proof)
- Revocation: View change
- Cost: O(n²) messages (PBFT), O(n) with threshold sigs (HotStuff)

**Commit Certificate**
- Scope: Request execution
- Lifetime: Permanent
- Binding: 2f+1 commit signatures
- Transitivity: Yes (anyone can verify)
- Revocation: Impossible
- Cost: Signature verification overhead

### Calculus Principles

**Epoch Boundaries**
- All evidence must be rebound at term/view changes
- Old epoch evidence becomes invalid but provides hints
- New leader must re-prove uncommitted decisions
- Binding: (epoch, replica_id, instance)

**Non-Transitive Proofs**
- Individual promises are not transitive
- Must collect fresh quorum for downstream decisions
- Cannot forward "I was promised" claims
- Example: Promise from acceptor A doesn't help convince acceptor B

**Evidence Absence Handling**
- Missing commit proof → Must treat as uncommitted
- Expired lease → Degrade to no-leader mode
- Insufficient quorum → Explicit unavailability response
- Never silently accept absence as "probably okay"

**Amortization Strategies**
- Leader lease amortizes prepare phase across multiple instances
- Pipelined proposals amortize network round trips
- Batching amortizes per-message overhead
- Multi-Paxos amortizes leadership establishment

## 3. TWENTY PROFOUND INSIGHTS ABOUT CONSENSUS

### Nature of Agreement

**Insight 1: Consensus is Converting Distributed Uncertainty into Shared Truth**
Every consensus protocol is fundamentally a machine for transforming individual opinions into collective facts. The magic lies not in perfect information but in creating evidence that survives failures. A quorum certificate isn't just data—it's a crystallized moment of distributed agreement that remains true even when the agreeing parties fail.

**Insight 2: Majorities Create Truth Through Intersection, Not Authority**
The majority requirement isn't about having more votes; it's about mathematical guarantee of information flow. When any majority accepts A and any majority accepts B, they must share at least one member who can detect the conflict. This is pure set theory manifesting as distributed correctness.

**Insight 3: Consensus Protocols Don't Prevent Disagreement—They Prevent Concurrent Commitment**
Nodes can propose different values, hold different opinions, and even vote differently. What's forbidden is committing to different values. The protocol structure ensures that by the time anyone commits, everyone who participates has seen evidence that makes alternative commitments impossible.

### Time and Order

**Insight 4: Consensus Generates Artificial Time from Timeless Messages**
Physical clocks are unreliable witnesses. Consensus creates logical time through causality: "This happened because a quorum agreed it happened." Proposal numbers, terms, and views are not timestamps—they're artificial epochs that impose order without requiring synchronized clocks.

**Insight 5: Every Consensus Instance is an Atomic Moment in Distributed History**
A committed consensus instance is like a geological layer: it happened after everything below it and before everything above it. This creates narrative structure in distributed systems—a total order of events that all replicas can reconstruct identically.

**Insight 6: The Gap Between Proposal and Commitment is Where Uncertainty Lives**
In flight messages carry proposals that might become reality. The protocol's job is to ensure that this quantum superposition of "possibly decided" collapses to exactly one outcome across all observers. Like Schrödinger's cat, the value is uncertain until the commit certificate is observed.

### Failure and Resilience

**Insight 7: Consensus is Possible Because Failures are Independent Events**
If all failures were correlated, consensus would be impossible. The protocol assumes that a majority can survive any single failure mode. This assumption—that f failures in different locations are statistically independent—is the bedrock of distributed resilience.

**Insight 8: Slow is Indistinguishable from Failed, So Consensus Must Tolerate Both**
The deepest impossibility: you cannot tell if a node is dead or just slow. Consensus protocols embrace this by making the same guarantees regardless. Safety never depends on distinguishing slow from crashed; only liveness does.

**Insight 9: Recovery is Just Catching Up on History Already Written**
When a node recovers, it doesn't need to redo consensus—it needs to learn what consensus decided in its absence. The evidence (commit certificates) still exists on surviving replicas. Recovery is reading the geological record, not re-creating it.

### Leader and Coordination

**Insight 10: Leaders are Optimizations, Not Requirements**
Leaderless consensus (EPaxos) proves that leaders aren't fundamental. But leaders are incredibly useful: they serialize decisions, reducing coordination from O(n²) to O(n). The leader is a designated serialization point, not a source of truth.

**Insight 11: Leadership is Evidence-Based Authority with an Expiration Date**
A leader holds a time-limited certificate (lease) proving it won an election. This isn't permanent power—it's a proof of temporary authority that expires and must be renewed. Every action taken under that lease is auditable and verifiable.

**Insight 12: Leadership Transition is When Safety and Liveness Tension Peak**
During election, the system prioritizes safety over progress. No decisions while sorting out leadership. This is the conscious choice: better to stall than to split brain. The protocol weaponizes unavailability to protect correctness.

### Byzantine and Trust

**Insight 13: Byzantine Fault Tolerance is Consensus Under Active Adversaries**
Crash faults are passive: nodes stop. Byzantine faults are active: nodes lie, collude, send different messages to different peers. The mathematics changes: 2f+1 for crashes becomes 3f+1 for Byzantine because you need to drown out malicious votes, not just absent ones.

**Insight 14: Cryptographic Signatures Turn Byzantine Problems into Crash Problems**
With unforgeable signatures, lies become detectable. A Byzantine node can still stay silent or delay, but it can't fake messages from others. Authenticated Byzantine consensus (n=2f+1) approaches crash consensus complexity (n=2f+1) with added crypto cost.

**Insight 15: The 3f+1 Bound is Not Engineering—It's Mathematics**
You cannot build a system that tolerates f Byzantine failures with fewer than 3f+1 nodes. This isn't a limitation of current protocols; it's a proven impossibility. Any claim otherwise is either changing the problem or the assumptions.

### Composition and Scale

**Insight 16: Consensus Doesn't Compose Automatically—Each Instance is Isolated**
Winning consensus on A and consensus on B doesn't give you consensus on (A,B). Multi-object transactions need additional coordination (2PC) or careful dependency tracking (EPaxos). Consensus is the atomic building block; composition requires explicit bridging.

**Insight 17: Sharding is the Only Way to Scale Consensus Beyond Single-Node Limits**
One Paxos group can only handle what one leader can serialize. True scale requires partitioning: thousands of independent consensus groups, each managing a shard. This transforms the problem: now you need routing, rebalancing, and cross-shard transactions.

**Insight 18: Every Consensus Instance Costs Communication—Budget Accordingly**
Consensus isn't free. Every instance requires multiple round trips, quorum coordination, and durable logging. High-throughput systems batch operations into single instances, amortizing the cost. Consensus is precious; spend it on decisions that matter.

### Theoretical Foundations

**Insight 19: The FLP Impossibility Says 'You Cannot Have It All'—Pick Your Constraint to Relax**
Deterministic consensus in pure asynchrony is impossible. Every real protocol escapes through one door: randomization (non-deterministic), timeouts (partial synchrony), or accepting non-termination (liveness sacrifice). Understanding which door your protocol uses explains its behavior under stress.

**Insight 20: Consensus is the Fundamental Primitive—Everything Else is Built On It**
Replicated state machines, distributed transactions, leader election, configuration management, atomic broadcast—all reduce to consensus. Master this one concept and you've grasped the load-bearing pillar of distributed systems. Everything else is composition, optimization, or application.

## 6. LEARNING SPIRAL: INTUITION → UNDERSTANDING → MASTERY

### Pass 1: INTUITION (The Felt Need)

**Story: The Database That Kept Two Truths**

Imagine you're running an online banking system. A customer tries to transfer $500 from checking to savings. Your application sends the request to your database... but which database? You have three replicas for fault tolerance.

The naive approach: send it to one replica, assume it works. But what if that replica crashes right after processing? The money vanishes—the checking account was debited, but the credit to savings is lost on a dead machine.

Okay, send it to all three replicas! But what if the network hiccups and only two receive it? Worse: what if two replicas process the transfer but receive it in a different order relative to another transaction? Customer deposits $100 and transfers $500 in rapid succession. Replica A sees: deposit $100, transfer $500 (success). Replica B sees: transfer $500 (fail—insufficient funds), deposit $100.

Now you have two databases with different realities. This isn't a bug—it's the fundamental problem of distributed systems. When information travels at the speed of light through imperfect networks to imperfect machines, how do we ensure everyone agrees on what actually happened?

**The Core Intuition**: We need a protocol that takes multiple independent computers, each with their own opinion, and produces a single immutable decision that all of them accept as truth—even if some fail during the process.

**Simple Fix**: Majority vote! If three replicas exist, require two to agree before calling it committed. If Replica A dies after agreeing, B and C still know it happened. When A recovers, it can learn from B or C.

**Why This Matters**: Without consensus, distributed systems would fracture into contradictory realities. Consensus is the glue that creates a single logical system from many physical machines.

---

### Pass 2: UNDERSTANDING (The Limits and Mechanisms)

**Why the Simple Fix Fails at Scale**

The majority vote idea is correct, but implementation is subtle. Consider these attacks on naive voting:

1. **The Split Brain**: Network partition splits your 5-node cluster into groups of 2 and 3. Both groups think they have a quorum! The group of 2 processes a transfer; the group of 3 processes a contradictory one. When the partition heals, you have two irreconcilable truths.

2. **The Time Traveler**: Node A crashes with value X committed. Nodes B, C, D, E don't know about X yet. After A crashes, they form a quorum and commit value Y for the same decision. When A recovers, it insists X was chosen. Who's right?

3. **The Eternal Election**: Five nodes keep trying to become leader simultaneously. Node 1 starts election, gets 2 votes. Node 2 starts election, gets 2 votes. Node 3 starts election... nobody ever wins. The system is live (all nodes working) but makes no progress.

**The Evidence-Based Solution**

Consensus protocols solve these by introducing phases and evidence:

**Phase 1: Establishing Leadership (The Prepare Phase)**
- Proposer generates a unique, totally ordered proposal number N
- Sends "Prepare(N)" to all acceptors
- Acceptor promises: "I won't accept any proposal < N" AND "here's the highest proposal I've already accepted"
- Proposer collects a majority of promises

**Evidence Generated**: Promise certificate = {majority of signed promises for N}

This phase establishes two things:
1. Authority: No proposal < N can now succeed (those promises blocked it)
2. History: If any value was already accepted, at least one promiser knows it

**Phase 2: Proposing the Value (The Accept Phase)**
- If any promiser reported an already-accepted value, proposer MUST propose that value
- Otherwise, proposer is free to choose any value
- Send "Accept(N, value)" to acceptors
- Acceptor accepts if it hasn't promised a higher N
- Collect majority of accepts

**Evidence Generated**: Accept certificate = {majority of signed accepts for (N, value)}

Once you have an accept certificate, that value is chosen. Immutably. Forever.

**Why This Works**

The split brain is impossible: If group {A,B,C} forms a quorum for N=5 with value X, and group {C,D,E} tries to form a quorum for N=6 with value Y, node C is in both groups. When N=6 is prepared, C must report "I already accepted (N=5, X)". The protocol forces the N=6 proposer to propose X, not Y. Agreement guaranteed.

The time traveler is neutralized: When A recovers and insists X was chosen, it has proof (accept certificate). New nodes must respect it. But if A has no certificate (it crashed before the quorum formed), then Y legitimately won and A must accept this.

**The Trade-offs Emerge**

- **Latency**: Two round trips minimum (prepare + accept). In wide-area networks, that's 200ms+.
- **Availability**: A partition that splits you into two equal groups (2+2 in a 4-node cluster) makes progress impossible. Majority is unavailable.
- **Complexity**: Recovering from failures mid-protocol requires careful state management.

**Optimizations That Matter**

- **Multi-Paxos/Raft**: Elect a stable leader who can skip Phase 1 for subsequent instances (amortize leadership establishment)
- **Leases**: Leader holds a time-limited lease, can make decisions unilaterally for that duration
- **Pipelining**: Don't wait for instance I to commit before starting I+1; overlap them
- **Batching**: Commit 1000 operations in a single consensus instance, amortizing the cost

### Pass 3: MASTERY (Operating in Reality)

**Choosing the Right Protocol**

| Your Scenario | Recommended Protocol | Rationale |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Single datacenter, crash faults only | Raft | Understandable, good tooling (etcd) |
| Need to explain to team, strong community | Raft | Pedagogy designed into protocol |
| Google-scale, already have Paxos expertise | Multi-Paxos | Battle-tested at extreme scale |
| Geo-distributed, low conflict rate | EPaxos | 1 RTT in common case, leaderless |
| Blockchain, untrusted participants | HotStuff/Tendermint | BFT with reasonable performance |
| Need formal verification | TLA+ spec available | Raft and Paxos have formal specs |

**Tuning for Your Workload**

Read-heavy system:
- Use leader leases for stale reads (no quorum needed)
- OR use CRAQ-style follower reads with freshness verification
- OR use flexible quorums: large Q1 (all nodes), small Q2 (any 1 node)

Write-heavy system:
- Pipeline aggressively (multiple in-flight proposals)
- Batch writes into single instances
- Consider sharding to parallelize (but beware cross-shard transactions)

Geo-distributed:
- Place leader near write sources
- Use EPaxos if no natural leader location
- Accept 100-300ms latency as physics tax
- DO NOT try synchronous consensus across oceans for user-facing writes

**Monitoring and Debugging**

Key Metrics:
1. **Commit latency P50/P99/P999**: Detect slowdowns before users complain
2. **Leadership stability**: Frequent elections indicate network or timeout issues
3. **Quorum failures**: Track when majority is unavailable
4. **Log growth rate**: Snapshots not keeping up?
5. **Follower lag**: Gap between leader commit and follower apply

Debug with Evidence:
- When investigating "wrong value committed", demand to see the accept certificate
- When debugging unavailability, trace: do we have a leader lease? Is quorum reachable?
- When recovering from partition, look for conflicting certificates (there should be none if protocol correct)

**Failure Modes You'll Actually See**

1. **Slow Disk on Leader**: Leader's fsync blocks commit, appears as high latency. Solution: Replace disk or move leader.

2. **Asymmetric Network Partition**: Node A sees B, but B doesn't see A. Leader thinks follower is dead, follower thinks leader is dead. Solution: Better failure detection (bidirectional heartbeats).

3. **Time Drift Breaking Leases**: Leader's clock drifts fast, lease expires early from followers' perspective. Solution: Use NTP, bound clock skew assumptions.

4. **Thundering Herd Elections**: All followers timeout simultaneously, trigger election at once, nobody wins. Solution: Randomized timeouts (Raft does this).

5. **Snapshot Transfer Blocking Progress**: Bringing up a new replica requires full state transfer, blocks leader. Solution: Throttle snapshot bandwidth, use incremental snapshots.

**When Consensus is NOT the Answer**

- High-throughput data ingest: Consensus can't keep up. Use partitioned logs (Kafka) or CRDTs.
- Cross-region user-facing writes: 200ms is too slow. Use async replication with conflict resolution.
- Massive scale (millions of shards): Per-shard consensus, not global.
- Untrusted computation: Consensus gives agreement, not correctness. Need verification (ZK proofs, TEEs).

**The Operator's Mental Model**

Think of your consensus cluster as a deliberative body:
- **Proposers** are advocates bringing motions to the floor
- **Acceptors** are voting members who can be convinced
- **Proposal numbers** are like session numbers—higher sessions override lower
- **Phases** are like "call for vote" (prepare) then "actual vote" (accept)
- **Commit certificates** are like signed minutes of the meeting

When things go wrong, ask: "What evidence exists?" If multiple nodes claim different truths, demand to see their certificates. Exactly one will have a valid quorum signature, or none will (in which case nothing was decided).

**The Path to Mastery**

1. **Implement**: Build basic Paxos or Raft from scratch. You'll internalize the invariants.
2. **Break It**: Intentionally violate safety (e.g., accept without prepare). Watch it split brain. Fix it.
3. **Profile**: Measure where time is spent (network? disk? CPU?). Optimize based on data.
4. **Scale**: Add sharding, deal with rebalancing and cross-shard transactions.
5. **Operate**: Run in production, debug incidents, tune timeouts, handle disk failures.

After this journey, consensus becomes intuitive. You'll see it everywhere: leader election is consensus on identity, configuration management is consensus on parameters, atomic broadcast is repeated consensus. Master this primitive and distributed systems unlock.

## 7. MODE MATRIX FOR DEGRADED OPERATIONS

### Mode: TARGET (Normal Operation)

**Preserved Invariants**: ALL (Uniqueness, Agreement, Validity, Termination)

**Evidence Required**:
- Leader lease (current, not expired)
- Quorum reachability (majority responding within timeout)
- Disk durability confirmation (fsync completed)

**Allowed Operations**:
- Propose new values: YES (leader serializes)
- Commit values: YES (with quorum accept)
- Read committed: YES (local to any replica)
- Read uncommitted: NO (never safe)
- Membership changes: YES (via protocol-specific reconfiguration)

**Typed Guarantee Vector**:
```
G_target = ⟨Scope: Global (cluster),
            Order: Total (strict serial),
            Visibility: SI (committed reads),
            Recency: Fresh(lease),
            Idempotence: Dedup(proposal_id),
            Auth: Signed(leader_cert)⟩
```

**User-Visible Contract**:
- All writes acknowledged are durable (survive f failures)
- All reads see committed state
- Latency: 1-2 RTT for writes, 0 RTT for reads (local)

**Entry Trigger**: Successful leader election + quorum established
**Exit Trigger**: Leader lease expiry OR quorum lost OR disk failure

---

### Mode: ELECTION (Leader Transition)

**Preserved Invariants**: Uniqueness, Agreement, Validity (Termination: delayed)

**Evidence Required**:
- Vote certificates (collecting f+1 votes)
- Term/view number incremented
- No outstanding uncommitted proposals

**Allowed Operations**:
- Propose: NO (no leader)
- Commit: NO (no leader)
- Read committed: YES (safe, state is immutable)
- Initiate election: YES (any node can trigger)

**Typed Guarantee Vector**:
```
G_election = ⟨Scope: Global,
              Order: Total (existing log),
              Visibility: SI (only committed),
              Recency: Stale(unknown_lag),
              Idempotence: N/A (no writes),
              Auth: Signed(candidate_certs)⟩
```

**User-Visible Contract**:
- Writes: REJECTED or TIMEOUT
- Reads: May return stale data (lag from last committed)
- Latency: Unpredictable (election in progress)

**Entry Trigger**: Heartbeat timeout OR higher term seen OR explicit stepdown
**Exit Trigger**: Candidate wins majority votes → TARGET mode
**Timeout**: If election fails, exponential backoff and retry

---

### Mode: DEGRADED (Partition or Minority)

**Preserved Invariants**: Uniqueness, Agreement, Validity (Termination: NO)

**Evidence Required**:
- Cannot form quorum (only f or fewer replicas reachable)
- Evidence of network partition (timeouts from majority)

**Allowed Operations**:
- Propose: NO (no quorum)
- Commit: NO (no quorum)
- Read committed: YES (safe, labeled as "stale possible")
- Read with staleness bound: YES (if bounded by last known commit)

**Typed Guarantee Vector**:
```
G_degraded = ⟨Scope: Local (minority shard),
              Order: Total (frozen log),
              Visibility: SI (last committed),
              Recency: BS(δ=unknown) OR EO (eventual only),
              Idempotence: N/A,
              Auth: Signed(stale)⟩
```

**User-Visible Contract**:
- Writes: EXPLICITLY REJECTED with "QUORUM_UNAVAILABLE"
- Reads: Labeled "STALE_POSSIBLE" or "BOUNDED_STALE(seconds_since_last_commit)"
- Latency: Fast (local reads), infinite (writes blocked)

**Entry Trigger**: Quorum loss detected (f+1 or more nodes unreachable)
**Exit Trigger**: Partition heals, quorum re-established → RECOVERY mode

**Critical Safety Property**: NEVER accept writes. Better to be unavailable than to split brain.

---

### Mode: RECOVERY (Rejoining After Failure)

**Preserved Invariants**: Uniqueness, Agreement, Validity (Termination: blocked until synchronized)

**Evidence Required**:
- Learning protocol active (querying replicas for uncommitted)
- State transfer in progress (catching up log)
- Snapshot available (if log too far behind)

**Allowed Operations**:
- Propose: NO (not yet synchronized)
- Commit: NO (catching up)
- Read: NO (state inconsistent until caught up)
- Learn: YES (receive log entries, snapshots)

**Typed Guarantee Vector**:
```
G_recovery = ⟨Scope: Local (recovering node),
              Order: Partial (gaps being filled),
              Visibility: Fractured (incomplete),
              Recency: N/A (not in service),
              Idempotence: N/A,
              Auth: Verifying(catching_up)⟩
```

**User-Visible Contract**:
- All operations: TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE
- This node is not in the serving set
- Client requests routed to healthy replicas

**Entry Trigger**: Node restart after crash OR partition heal
**Exit Trigger**: Caught up to leader's commit index → TARGET mode

**Recovery Protocol**:
1. Contact leader, learn current term/view
2. Request log entries from last known commit to leader's commit
3. If gap too large, request snapshot
4. Apply entries in order
5. Signal "ready to serve"

---

### Mode Transition Table

| From | To | Trigger | Actions | Safety Check |
|------|-----|---------|---------|--------------|
| TARGET | ELECTION | Heartbeat timeout | Increment term, request votes | No in-flight uncommitted |
| ELECTION | TARGET | Win majority votes | Establish lease, commit no-op | Learn any uncommitted |
| ELECTION | DEGRADED | Lose partition, can't win | Stop candidacy, enter read-only | N/A |
| TARGET | DEGRADED | Quorum lost | Revoke lease, reject writes | Ensure no new commits |
| DEGRADED | RECOVERY | Partition heals | Initiate catch-up | Verify term still current |
| RECOVERY | TARGET | Caught up | Join quorum | Verify commit index matches |
| ANY | RECOVERY | Restart/crash | Learn current state | Discard uncommitted |

---

## 8. GUARANTEE VECTORS FOR CONSENSUS PROTOCOLS

### Paxos (Basic, Single-Shot)

```
G_paxos_basic = ⟨Scope: Object (single instance),
                 Order: None (single decision, no relation to others),
                 Visibility: SI (agreed value is immediately consistent),
                 Recency: Fresh(quorum_cert),
                 Idempotence: None (application must dedupe),
                 Auth: Unauth OR Signed(optional)⟩
```

**Composition Behavior**:
- Sequential instances: Manually number them for order
- No automatic cross-instance guarantees
- Each instance independent

---

### Multi-Paxos (Replicated Log)

```
G_multipaxos = ⟨Scope: Global (entire log),
                Order: Total (strict sequence),
                Visibility: SI (committed prefix),
                Recency: Fresh(leader_lease),
                Idempotence: Dedup(client_id+seq),
                Auth: Signed(leader_cert)⟩
```

**Composition Upgrades**:
- Leader lease upgrades Basic Paxos by amortizing Phase 1
- Sequential numbering creates total order
- State machine replication gives cross-instance semantics

**Degradation Points**:
- Lease expiry: ⤓ to Election mode, Recency becomes Stale
- Quorum loss: ⤓ to Degraded mode, Order frozen, Visibility stale

---

### Raft (Replicated Log)

```
G_raft = ⟨Scope: Global (cluster),
          Order: Total (log index),
          Visibility: SI (committed entries),
          Recency: Fresh(leader_term),
          Idempotence: Dedup(log_index),
          Auth: Signed(term_cert)⟩
```

**Key Difference from Multi-Paxos**:
- Raft's log matching property provides stronger invariant: "if two entries have same index and term, all preceding entries are identical"
- This simplifies reasoning but restricts flexibility

**Composition Safety**:
- Cannot commit out of order (must commit index I before I+1)
- Snapshot transfers preserve prefix consistency

---

### EPaxos (Leaderless, Dependency-Ordered)

```
G_epaxos = ⟨Scope: Object (per-command),
            Order: Partial (dependency graph),
            Visibility: SI (after dependencies),
            Recency: Fresh(unanimous_deps) OR BS(δ) (slow path),
            Idempotence: Dedup(cmd_id),
            Auth: Signed(optional)⟩
```

**Composition Algebra**:
- Commands A and B commute if ¬conflict(A,B)
- If conflict, dependency edge A → B or B → A established
- Execution: topological sort of dependency graph

**Upgrade Opportunity**:
- Fast path (unanimous dependencies): 1 RTT
- Slow path (conflict on dependencies): 2 RTT (runs Paxos to agree on deps)

**Degradation**:
- Cannot execute command until dependencies satisfied
- May wait indefinitely if dependency is lost (needs recovery)

---

### PBFT (Byzantine, Total Order)

```
G_pbft = ⟨Scope: Global (view),
          Order: Total (sequence number),
          Visibility: SER (serializable with BFT),
          Recency: Fresh(2f+1_commits),
          Idempotence: Dedup(client_timestamp),
          Auth: Signed(client+replicas)⟩
```

**Evidence Strength**:
- Requires 2f+1 signatures at each phase (stronger than crash consensus f+1)
- Prepare + Commit phases both need Byzantine quorum
- View change requires proof of stalled progress

**Composition Cost**:
- O(n²) messages (all-to-all) makes large clusters impractical
- Threshold signatures reduce to O(n) but add crypto cost

---

### HotStuff (Byzantine, Linear)

```
G_hotstuff = ⟨Scope: Global (view),
              Order: Total (height in blockchain),
              Visibility: SER (BFT serializable),
              Recency: Fresh(QC_commit),
              Idempotence: Dedup(client_nonce),
              Auth: Signed(threshold_sig)⟩
```

**Innovation**:
- All phases identical structure: node → leader → QC → next phase
- Threshold signatures aggregate 2f+1 signatures into one
- O(n) message complexity (linear in cluster size)

**Composition Benefit**:
- Can chain HotStuff instances (blockchain)
- Finality: After 3 phases (Prepare → Pre-commit → Commit), block is final

---

### Guarantee Composition Example: Multi-Paxos with Follower Reads

**Baseline Multi-Paxos**:
```
G_leader_read = ⟨Global, Total, SI, Fresh(lease), Dedup, Auth⟩
```

**Adding Follower Reads**:
```
G_follower_read = ⟨Local(follower), Total, SI, BS(δ=replication_lag), Dedup, Auth⟩
```

**Composition Rule**:
- If application can tolerate BS(δ), route to follower
- If application requires Fresh(lease), must route to leader
- **Meet operation**: Weakest component dominates
  - Recency: Fresh ∧ BS(δ) = BS(δ)
  - Scope: Global ∧ Local = Local

**Upgrade Path**:
- Add read index protocol (follower asks leader for commit index)
- Follower waits until applied ≥ commit index
- Now: `G_follower_upgrade = ⟨Local, Total, SI, Fresh(read_index), Dedup, Auth⟩`
- Cost: Extra round trip to leader (but no quorum)

---

### Cross-Protocol Composition: Paxos + 2PC

**Scenario**: Cross-shard transaction needs atomicity across multiple Paxos groups.

**Per-Shard Guarantee**:
```
G_shard = ⟨Global(shard), Total, SI, Fresh(lease), Dedup, Auth⟩
```

**2PC Coordinator Guarantee**:
```
G_2pc = ⟨Global(transaction), Atomic(all-or-nothing), SI, Fresh(coord_lease), Dedup(txn_id), Auth⟩
```

**Composed Guarantee**:
```
G_cross_shard = meet(G_shard_A, G_shard_B, G_2pc)
              = ⟨Global(txn), Total(partial within shards, atomic across), SI, Fresh(min(leases)), Dedup(txn_id), Auth⟩
```

**Degradation Risk**:
- If any shard's Paxos enters DEGRADED mode, entire transaction aborts
- Coordinator failure: Participants may block (need timeout + abort protocol)

**Capsule Required at Shard Boundary**:
```json
{
  "invariant": "Atomic cross-shard commit",
  "evidence": {
    "transaction_id": "txn-12345",
    "prepare_votes": ["shard-A-yes", "shard-B-yes"],
    "coordinator_decision": "COMMIT",
    "coordinator_lease": "valid until T+5s"
  },
  "boundary": "shard-A, shard-B",
  "mode": "TARGET (both shards)",
  "fallback": "ABORT if any shard unavailable"
}
```

### Guarantee Vector Algebra Summary

**Operations**:
1. **Meet (∧)**: Weakest component wins (composition of services)
2. **Upgrade (↑)**: Add evidence to strengthen component
3. **Downgrade (⤓)**: Explicit weakening with labeling
4. **Restrict**: Narrow scope to maintain safety
5. **Extend**: Widen scope only with upgrade evidence

**Key Composition Laws**:
- Associative: (A ∧ B) ∧ C = A ∧ (B ∧ C)
- Commutative: A ∧ B = B ∧ A
- Idempotent: A ∧ A = A
- Upgrade-then-meet: (A ↑ e) ∧ B = (A ∧ B) if B lacks e's component
- Downgrade-is-explicit: A ⤓ never implicit, always labeled

**Example Composition Chain**:
```
Client Request → API Gateway → Consensus Cluster → Replicated DB

G_client = ⟨Global, None, Fractured, EO, None, Unauth⟩
          ↑ (add session token)
G_gateway = ⟨Global, None, RA, EO, Idem(req_id), Auth(session)⟩
          ↑ (consensus commit)
G_consensus = ⟨Global, Total, SI, Fresh(lease), Idem(req_id), Auth(session)⟩
          ∧ (replicate)
G_final = ⟨Global, Total, SI, BS(δ=replication_lag), Idem(req_id), Auth(session)⟩

Final user guarantee: Strongly ordered, eventually replicated, idempotent, authenticated.
```

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

### Irreducible Sentence
**"Consensus transforms distributed uncertainty into certified agreement through quorum-based evidence that survives failures and preserves uniqueness."**

### Core Mental Models Established
1. **Quorums create truth through intersection**, not authority
2. **Evidence has a lifecycle**: generated, validated, expired
3. **Phases separate concerns**: leadership from decision-making
4. **Modes define degradation**: explicit trade-offs under stress
5. **Guarantees compose via vectors**: weakest link determines end-to-end promise

### Connections to Future Chapters
- Chapter 4 (Replication): Uses consensus to maintain replica consistency
- Chapter 5 (Evolution): Shows how consensus enabled modern architectures
- Chapter 6 (Storage): Consensus underlies distributed transactions
- Chapter 7 (Cloud): Kubernetes/etcd use Raft for control plane consensus

### Transfer Tests
- **Near**: Apply consensus to leader election (same problem, different domain)
- **Medium**: Use consensus concepts for human decision-making in organizations (quorums, evidence, phases)
- **Far**: Understand scientific consensus as social consensus protocol (peer review = quorum validation)
