  - [ ] Deterministic thread scheduling (or avoid threads)
  - [ ] Fixed order for parallel results aggregation
  - Example: Race on counter vs map-reduce with sorted aggregation

- **7. External Input**
  - [ ] Log all external inputs (API calls, user input)

#### When to Use Hardware Acceleration
- **Use SmartNICs when:**
  - Consensus latency is critical (<1ms required)
  - CPU is bottlenecked on networking
  - Security/encryption overhead is high
  - Multi-tenant isolation needs hardware enforcement

- **Use SmartSSDs when:**
  - Large table scans are common
  - Aggregations dominate workload
  - Data-to-compute ratio > 100:1
  - Storage IOPS is the bottleneck

- **Use FPGAs when:**
  - Custom algorithms benefit from parallelism
  - Latency requirements are extreme (<10μs)
  - Workload is compute-heavy but data-local
  - Willing to invest in FPGA development

- **Stay with CPU when:**
  - Workload is branchy/unpredictable
  - Rapid iteration/development needed
  - Cost of custom hardware exceeds benefits
  - Workload doesn't justify complexity
