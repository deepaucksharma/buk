## Expansion Methodology

Each section was expanded by:
1. **Breaking down concepts** into constituent parts
2. **Adding implementation details** (algorithms, data structures)
3. **Including practical examples** (configurations, code)
4. **Covering trade-offs** (performance, cost, complexity)
5. **Adding real-world context** (production systems, incidents)
6. **Providing worked examples** (calculations, scenarios)
7. **Linking theory to practice** (formal methods to production)

## Quality Standards

Each expanded section aims to:
- ✓ Define terms and concepts clearly
- ✓ Provide historical context where relevant
- ✓ Include mathematical foundations
- ✓ Show implementation patterns
- ✓ Give production examples
- ✓ Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- ✓ Reference real systems and papers
- ✓ Include metrics and benchmarks
- ✓ Cover failure modes and recovery
- ✓ Address operational concerns

## Relationship to Actual Chapters

These expanded TOCs are:
- **Planning documents** - Not the chapters themselves
- **Structural guides** - Outline organization
- **Scope definitions** - Clarify what's covered
- **Blueprints** - Guide the writing process

The actual chapters would:
- Follow this structure
- Add prose and explanations
- Expand examples into full text
- Include figures and diagrams
- Provide citations and references
- Add exercises and problems

## Coverage Philosophy

### Comprehensive but Focused
- Cover topics in appropriate depth
- Avoid tangential material
- Prioritize production relevance
- Balance theory and practice

### Progression
- Fundamentals first
- Build complexity gradually
- Connect concepts across chapters
- Culminate in advanced topics

### Practical Orientation
- Real-world examples
- Production metrics
- Operational procedures
- Cost considerations
- Trade-off analysis
