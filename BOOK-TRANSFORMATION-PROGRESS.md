## 💡 Key Insights from Transformation

### What's Working
1. **Systematic approach** with templates produces consistent quality
2. **Guarantee vectors** make trade-offs explicit and memorable
3. **Transfer tests** validate deep understanding
4. **Evidence-first** thinking clarifies system behavior
5. **Mode matrices** make degradation predictable

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Token limits** when transforming large sections
2. **Complexity** of maintaining consistency across chapters
3. **Time investment** - each chapter needs 2-3 days of focused work
4. **Validation overhead** - ensuring all elements present

### Lessons Learned
1. **Baby steps** with focused agents produce better results
2. **Templates** are essential for consistency
3. **Examples** make abstract concepts concrete
4. **Validation** should be continuous, not just at end
