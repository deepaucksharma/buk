chapter-agnostic “operating system” you can apply uniformly across the book. It upgrades your 3.0 framework with a richer invariant hierarchy, a typed guarantee vector and algebra, a fuller evidence calculus, a principled mode matrix, canonical lenses (STA + DCEH), dualities, visual grammar, author canvases, and review tooling. It stays insight-first and is designed to make every chapter feel like one mind teaching the same few powerful mental models. every section you write reinforce a coherent mental model across the book—minimizing one-off technical details and numbers, and maximizing transferable understanding. 

The Unified Mental Model Authoring Framework 3.0 (Expanded Edition)
A Cognitive Architecture for Deep, Transferable Understanding

Foundation: The Single Unifying Principle
Every distributed system is a machine for preserving invariants across space and time by converting uncertainty into evidence.
Everything else follows from this: mechanisms manufacture evidence; architecture shapes where evidence must flow; composition ensures evidence survives boundary crossings; operations use evidence to decide when to degrade or recover.

Coherence over completeness: each idea should reinforce a small set of core mental models.
Unification over enumeration: prefer patterns, invariants, and “why it must be so” over “how we tuned it.”
Cross-chapter threads: concepts should recur intentionally, not accidentally; every recurrence strengthens the same core model.
Reader agency: teach how to think, not what to memorize.

Part I: The Cognitive Architecture

1) The Three-Layer Mental Model
Every concept sits at exactly one layer, references the layer below, and supports the one above.

Layer 1: The Eternal Truths (Physics)
What cannot be changed
- Information diverges without energy
- No universal “now” exists
- Agreement requires communication
- Evidence has cost and lifetime
- Composition weakens guarantees

Layer 2: The Design Patterns (Strategies)
How we navigate reality
- Protect invariants with mechanisms
- Generate evidence through agreement
- Avoid coordination through design
- Degrade predictably under stress
- Compose with explicit contracts

Layer 3: The Implementation Choices (Tactics)
What we build
- Specific protocols (Raft, Paxos, EPaxos, HotStuff)
- Specific structures (LSM, B-tree, Merkle/Verkle)
- Specific proofs (certificates, leases, timestamps)
- Specific modes (floor, target, degraded, recovery)
- Specific boundaries (service, shard, region, org)

2) Canonical Lenses (Always-On Views)
Use these lenses in every chapter; they align thinking without tool trivia.

- STA triad (State, Time, Agreement)
  - State: what changes and tends to diverge; how we reconcile
  - Time: how we order effects; clocks are instruments, not truth
  - Agreement: how opinions become facts and produce evidence

- DCEH planes (Data, Control, Evidence, Human)
  - Data: high-volume flows and invariant checks
  - Control: decisions, hierarchy, and policy rollout
  - Evidence: the artifacts that certify state, order, identity
  - Human: operator mental model, safe actions, and observables

- Value and Governance planes (contextual overlays)
  - Value: what we protect or trade off (trust, safety, business)
  - Governance: privacy, compliance, and cross-organization trust as invariants

3) The Invariant Hierarchy (with a Catalog)
Organize invariants; pick from here so names and meanings stay consistent.

Fundamental (always sacred)
- Conservation (nothing created/destroyed except via authorized flows)
- Uniqueness (at most one of X)
- Authenticity/Integrity (only authorized, untampered changes)

Derived (built on fundamentals)
- Order (A precedes B; often needs unique positions)
- Exclusivity (temporary uniqueness: leases, locks)
- Monotonicity (progress cannot go backward)

Composite (combinations that users feel)
- Freshness (order + recency bound)
- Visibility/Coherent cut (atomic views of multiple objects)
- Convergence (independent updates meet at a join)
- Idempotence (repeated actions produce same outcome)
- Bounded staleness (divergence limited by contract δ)
- Availability promise (respond within a behavioral model)

For each invariant in chapters:
- Threat model: how it’s attacked (delay, skew, replay, split brain, gray failures)
- Protection boundary: where we enforce it (service, shard, region)
- Evidence needed: what certifies it (lease epoch, commit cert, closed timestamp, signature)
- Degradation semantics: the minimum acceptable truth under stress
- Repair pattern: reconcile, re-elect, reissue, re-prove, compensate

4) Dualities Map (Design Tensions)
Make trade-offs explicit using the same set of dualities:

- Safety ↔ Liveness
- Local ↔ Global
- Coordination ↔ Confluence
- Freshness ↔ Availability
- Determinism ↔ Adaptivity
- Evidence ↔ Trust
- Strong-here ↔ Weak-everywhere

For each duality you touch:
- Which invariant is at stake?
- What evidence allows you to move along the spectrum?
- Which mode (floor/target/degraded/recovery) you’re in and why?

5) Evidence Lifecycle and Calculus
Every proof follows a lifecycle and is governed by scope, lifetime, and binding rules.

Lifecycle (state machine)
Generated → Validated → Active → Expiring → Expired → Renewed/Revoked

Evidence taxonomy
- Order/Commit: quorum certificates, commit certificates, append-only positions
- Recency: lease epochs, read-index proofs, closed/safe timestamps
- Inclusion/Consistency: Merkle/Verkle proofs, range/consistency proofs
- Identity/Attestation: signatures, TEEs, SBOM provenance

Properties to state in every chapter
- Scope (object, range, transaction, epoch, configuration, tenant)
- Lifetime (expiry/renewal rules; epoch transitions)
- Binding (who/what it’s valid for; caller/tenant/path)
- Transitivity (can downstream rely on it?)
- Revocation (how invalidation is signaled; what happens after)
- Cost (generation vs verification; possibilities for amortization)

Calculus principles
- Rebind evidence at identity/epoch/scope boundaries
- Non-transitive proofs must be re-verified or replaced downstream
- Evidence absence or expiry must force explicit downgrade—not silent acceptance

Part II: The Unified Composition Framework

6) Typed Guarantee Vector (Beyond S/B/L/W)
Instead of a single label, type guarantees as a small vector. Composition is a component-wise “meet” (weakest wins).

G = ⟨Scope, Order, Visibility, Recency, Idempotence, Auth⟩

- Scope ∈ {Object, Range, Transaction, Global}
- Order ∈ {None, Causal, Lx (per-object linearizable), SS (strict serializable)}
- Visibility ∈ {Fractured, RA (read-atomic), SI (snapshot), SER (serializable)}
- Recency ∈ {EO (eventual only), BS(δ), Fresh(φ)}  // φ = verifiable proof form
- Idempotence ∈ {None, Idem(K)}                  // K = dedupe keying discipline
- Auth ∈ {Unauth, Auth(π)}                        // π = identity/attestation primitive

Composition operators
- Sequential A ▷ B: meet vectors; if B requires evidence that A didn’t pass, downgrade or insert an upgrade step (re-prove).
- Parallel A || B → Merge: meet(A, B) plus merge semantics (e.g., CRDT join vs serialized union).
- Upgrade ↑: introduce new evidence to raise one or more components (e.g., EO ↑ Lx via lease+fence).
- Downgrade ⤓: explicit and labeled (e.g., SS ⤓ SI; Fresh(φ) ⤓ BS(δ)).

Rules of thumb
- Weakest component governs end-to-end promise.
- Strong → weak = weak unless upgrade evidence is provided at the boundary.
- Weak → strong requires new evidence or serialization—never free.
- Absence of a “context capsule” implies downgrade.

7) The Context Capsule Protocol (Extended)
Capsules are the vehicles carrying guarantees and the basis for composition.

Minimal capsule (always present at boundaries)
{
  invariant: Which property is being preserved
  evidence:  Proof(s) validating it (typed, scoped)
  boundary:  Valid scope/domain and epoch
  mode:      Current mode (floor/target/degraded/recovery)
  fallback:  Authorized downgrade if verification fails
}

Optional capsule fields (as needed)
- scope: {Object|Range|Txn|Global}
- order: desired order class (Causal|Lx|SS)
- recency: desired recency contract (Fresh(φ)|BS(δ)|EO)
- identity: caller/tenant binding and nonce
- trace: causality token/session context
- obligations: what the receiver must check/return

Capsule operations
- restrict(): narrow scope to maintain safety at a boundary
- extend(): widen scope only after upgrade (↑) evidence obtained
- rebind(): bind to a new identity/epoch/domain
- renew(): refresh expiring evidence
- degrade(): apply fallback policy with explicit labeling

8) The Mode Matrix (Principled Degradation)
Modes define contracts under stress; they compose across services.

Modes
- Floor: minimum viable correctness (never lie; may be partial)
- Target: normal operation (primary guarantees)
- Degraded: reduced guarantees, labeled and principled
- Recovery: restricted actions until proofs re-established

For each service and mode, define:
- Preserved invariants (pick from catalog)
- Accepted/required evidence types (and lifetimes)
- Allowed operations and their typed guarantees (G vectors)
- User-visible contract (what changes, what never does)
- Entry/exit triggers (evidence-based, not time-only)

Cross-service compatibility
- Upstream Target cannot override downstream Degraded; downstream’s mode governs the final promise.
- Contracts specify mandatory capsule fields; calls without them must degrade or be rejected.

9) The Composition Ladder (Visual + Rules)
Keep a simple visual for readers, backed by the vector underneath.

Strong (SS/Lx + Fresh(φ) + SI)  ─ upgrading evidence ─►
Bounded (BS(δ) + SI/RA)        ─┬─ explicit labels ──►
Local/Weak (EO + per-object)    ─┘

Composition rules:
- Always be explicit about which rung you end on.
- Label every downgrade and justify it via absent/expired evidence.
- Show the upgrade step and the evidence that enables it.

Part III: The Pedagogical Framework

10) The Learning Spiral (3 Passes)
- Pass 1: Intuition (felt need)
  - Failure story, invariant at risk, simple fix
- Pass 2: Understanding (limits)
  - Why simple fails at scale; evidence-based solution; trade-offs
- Pass 3: Mastery (composition)
  - How it composes; mode matrix under stress; operator mental model

11) The Transfer Test Framework (3 Distances)
- Near: same pattern, nearby domain (e.g., new keyspace)
- Medium: related problem (e.g., resource allocation)
- Far: novel domain (e.g., human processes)

12) Cognitive Load Guardrails
- Introduce at most three new ideas per chapter:
  - One invariant (from the catalog)
  - One evidence type (from lifecycle)
  - One composition pattern (from algebra)
- Everything else reinforces prior concepts.

13) Socratic Prompt Library (Margin Cues)
- Which invariant is protected here?
- What uncertainty remains and why can’t we eliminate it cheaply?
- What evidence lets us act now?
- What changes at this boundary?
- If evidence vanishes, how do we degrade while preserving truth?
- What capsule must cross to keep guarantees intact?

14) Metaphor Lexicon (Consistent Anchors)
- Passport: evidence as travel documents
- Budget: coordination as spend
- Immune system: adaptation and defense
- Geology: layers, pressure, and time
- Market: trade-offs and evidence economy

- Weight: Thick (strong), Medium (bounded), Thin (weak)

Part VI: Integration Across the Book

20) Resonance Plan (Always-Recur Threads)
Mark these threads in sidebars and revisit intentionally:
- Recency proofs (evidence-first access)
- Causality vs real time (ordering, not timestamps)
- Coordination budget (spend only where non-confluent)
- Hierarchy (physics-driven layers)
- Determinism and replay (diagnosis, provability)
- Degraded semantics (predictable and principled)
- Composition via context capsules (guarantees travel with proof)
- Governance invariants (privacy/deletion as first-class)

21) Constraint vs Choice Mapping
For each chapter:
- Constraints: physics and impossibilities that bind design
- Choices: mechanisms that fit the same invariant/evidence grammar
- Show how dualities and modes guide choices under stress

22) Seeded Invariants per Book Part (Author Aids)
- Foundations: impossibility boundaries, partial synchrony assumptions
- State/Consistency: visibility, order, convergence
- Time: monotonicity, causality preservation, bounded staleness claims
- Agreement/Trust: uniqueness (leader), order/commit, authenticity
- Evolution of Solutions: same invariants realized by different mechanisms
- Architecture/Practice: conservation (resources), bounded staleness, idempotence
- Composition/Failures/Economics/Future: end-to-end properties and governance

Part VII: Review and Validation

23) Three-Pass Review Protocol (Plus Two)
- Pass 1: Invariant Consistency
  - Every mechanism maps to an invariant
  - Every failure threatens an invariant
  - Every recovery restores an invariant
- Pass 2: Evidence Completeness
  - Every decision requires evidence
  - Every evidence has scope, lifetime, binding, revocation
  - Every boundary verifies evidence or degrades explicitly
- Pass 3: Composition Soundness
  - Every path is typed (G vectors)
  - Every boundary carries a capsule
  - Every downgrade is explicit and labeled
- Pass 4: Mode Discipline
  - Modes are used consistently; transitions are evidence-triggered
  - Cross-service compatibility is respected
- Pass 5: Human Model
  - Operators’ See/Think/Do is spelled out
  - Incident stories match the invariant/evidence narrative

24) Reader Validation (Comprehension Ladder)
- Identify: “This mechanism protects invariant X.”
- Predict: “Without evidence Y, failure path is Z.”
- Design: “To protect X under condition C, do … with evidence …”
- Debug: “This failure implies missing/expired evidence …”
- Innovate: “We could protect X differently by …; composition remains sound because …”

25) Insight Density Triggers (Per Page)
- Connection revealed (“X is really Y”)
- Trade-off clarified (“We accept A to protect B”)
- Pattern recognized (“This is the same as Z, rephrased”)
- Boundary understood (“Guarantee changes here because …”)
- Evidence valued (“This proof enables … and lasts until …”)

Worked Mini-Example (How to Apply)
Topic: Follower Reads

- Invariant: “Never represent data as fresher than it is” (Freshness).
- Uncertainty: replica lag; leadership staleness.
- Evidence: closed/safe timestamp φ or lease epoch E + read-index receipt.
- Guarantee vector: G = ⟨Range, Lx, SI, Fresh(φ), Idem(K), Auth(π)⟩ if verified; else ⤓ to ⟨Range, —, SI, BS(δ), Idem(K), Auth(π)⟩.
- Capsule: {invariant: Freshness, evidence: φ or E, boundary: range/epoch, mode: Target, fallback: BS(δ)}
- Modes:
  - Target: return Fresh(φ) reads
  - Degraded: return labeled BS(δ) or fail closed
  - Recovery: re-prove φ/E before enabling Target
- Dualities: freshness vs availability; safety vs responsiveness
- Human: See (evidence channel health), Think (is φ/E valid now?), Do (toggle degraded policy, re-prove, re-enable)

Using this 3.0 (Expanded) OS
- Authors: Use the canvases to outline chapters; type end-to-end paths; carry capsules across boundaries; draw the five diagrams with consistent symbols; run the mental linter before PR.
- Reviewers: Apply the five-pass review; check the resonance plan and concept echo map; reject hidden downgrades or evidence-free claims.
- Readers: Expect the same grammar everywhere—STA + DCEH lenses, invariant/evidence pairs, typed guarantees, capsules at boundaries, and principled modes.

Success looks like this
Any reader can look at a new distributed system and:
- Name the invariants being protected
- Identify the evidence being generated and its lifecycle
- Trace guarantee composition via typed vectors and capsules
- Predict the degradation modes and operator actions
- Explain all of it with the same vocabulary, without memorizing any specific implementation

If you’d like, I can supply:
- Fillable Chapter/Concept/Mode/Path templates
- A small icon set and diagram stencils for the five diagrams
- A baseline invariant/evidence “seed” per chapter of your TOC
- A lightweight mental linter you can run on drafts (regex-based for capsules, invariants, modes, and G vectors)
