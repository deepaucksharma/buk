## üí° Key Innovations - EXPANDED

### 1. Guarantee Vectors (Enhanced)
```
G = ‚ü®Scope, Order, Visibility, Recency, Idempotence, Auth‚ü©
```
Now applied across:
- Service mesh (Identity, Authorization, Routing, Reliability)
- Coordination (Scope, Latency, Availability, Consistency, Cost)
- Transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Security (Authenticity, Authorization, Integrity, Confidentiality)
- Observability (Coverage, Granularity, Latency, Retention)

### 2. Evidence-Based Reasoning (Comprehensive)
Every system decision backed by evidence with:
- **5 Evidence Types**: Cryptographic, Behavioral, Environmental, Temporal, Structural
- **6 Evidence Properties**: Scope, Lifetime, Binding, Transitivity, Revocation, Cost
- **Complete Evidence Lifecycle**: Generate ‚Üí Propagate ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Expire ‚Üí Renew/Revoke

### 3. Mode Matrices (Universal Pattern)
Four operational modes applied consistently:
- **Floor**: Minimum viable correctness
- **Target**: Normal operation
- **Degraded**: Reduced guarantees
- **Recovery**: Restoration in progress

Applied to: Service mesh, security, observability, transactions, coordination

### 4. Context Capsules (Production-Ready)
Evidence carriers with structure:
```json
{
  "invariant": "...",
  "evidence": {...},
  "boundary": "...",
  "mode": "...",
  "fallback": "..."
}
```
Implemented for: Security, service mesh, transactions, multi-cloud

### 5. Sacred Diagrams (Visual Grammar)
Five diagram types established:
1. **Invariant Guardian**: Protection boundaries
2. **Evidence Flow**: Evidence propagation paths
3. **Composition Ladder**: Guarantee composition
4. **Mode Compass**: Mode transition triggers
5. **Knowledge vs Data Flow**: Information movement

### 6. Transfer Learning (Validated Pattern)
Near/Medium/Far exercises in every major chapter:
- Near: Same domain, different context
- Medium: Adjacent domain
- Far: Completely different domain
