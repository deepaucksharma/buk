# Cross-Cutting Topic: Data Governance & Privacy

## Overview

Data governance and privacy concerns permeate every layer of distributed systems, from storage engines to cross-region replication. This chapter explores how to implement retention policies, deletion guarantees, encryption, and compliance requirements across distributed architectures.

---

## 1. Retention & TTL Across Distributed Systems

### 1.1 TTL Design Patterns

#### 1.1.1 Local TTL Implementation
**Storage Layer TTL**
```
Time-based deletion markers:
- Per-key timestamps: overhead = 8 bytes/key
- Block-level expiry: overhead = 8 bytes/block (4KB-64KB)
- Segment-level expiry: overhead = 8 bytes/segment (1GB-10GB)

Trade-offs:
├─ Per-key: Precise expiry, high overhead
├─ Block-level: Moderate precision, low overhead
└─ Segment-level: Coarse precision, minimal overhead
```

**Compaction-Based Deletion**
- SSTable compaction filters
- TTL evaluated during merge operations
- No immediate deletion guarantee
- Space reclamation on compaction schedule

**Implementation Example (RocksDB-style):**
```cpp
// Compaction filter for TTL
class TTLCompactionFilter : public CompactionFilter {
  bool Filter(const Slice& key, const Slice& value) {
    uint64_t expiry_ts = DecodeTimestamp(value);
    uint64_t current_ts = hlc.Now().WallTime();
    return current_ts > expiry_ts; // Delete if expired
  }
};

// Per-column family TTL
ColumnFamilyOptions opts;
opts.ttl = 86400; // 24 hours in seconds
```

**Production Metrics:**
- Cassandra: Tombstone TTL = 10 days (gc_grace_seconds)
- Redis: Active expiry = 10 keys/sec, Passive expiry = 1/10 accesses
- DynamoDB: TTL processing latency = 48 hours typical

#### 1.1.2 Distributed TTL Challenges

**Clock Skew Impact**
```
Scenario: 3-node cluster with 100ms clock skew

Node A (clock +100ms):
  - Writes key with TTL=1000ms at t=1000 (local)
  - Effective wall time = 1100ms

Node B (clock -50ms):
  - Reads same key at t=1050 (local)
  - Effective wall time = 1000ms
  - Key appears expired (1000 >= 1100) but still valid!

Solution: HLC-based TTL
  - Store expiry as HLC timestamp
  - Compare using HLC comparison rules
  - Accounts for clock skew automatically
```

**Multi-Region TTL Coordination**
```
Challenge: Different regions may have different local times

Approach 1: Global Coordinator
  ├─ Single authority for time-based decisions
  ├─ High latency for cross-region checks
  └─ Single point of failure

Approach 2: Leader-Region TTL
  ├─ Home region owns TTL decisions
  ├─ Followers synchronize tombstones
  └─ Bounded staleness = max replication lag

Approach 3: Conservative TTL
  ├─ Add max_clock_skew buffer to all TTLs
  ├─ TTL_effective = TTL_requested + max_skew
  └─ Trades precision for correctness
```

### 1.2 Cascading Deletion

#### 1.2.1 Referential Integrity in Distributed Systems

**Orphan Prevention Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Two-Phase Delete**
```
Phase 1: Mark for deletion (soft delete)
  - Set tombstone marker
  - Replicate marker to all regions
  - Wait for acknowledgment quorum

Phase 2: Hard delete after grace period
  - Grace period ≥ max_replication_lag + safety_margin
  - Typical values: 10-60 minutes
  - Background garbage collection

Example (User deletion):
  1. Mark user_id=123 as deleted (t=0)
  2. Wait replication to all regions (t+5min)
  3. Asynchronously delete dependent records
     - user_sessions (t+10min)
     - user_preferences (t+15min)
     - user_activity_logs (t+20min)
  4. Hard delete user record (t+60min)
```

**Strategy 2: Tombstone Propagation**
```
Graph structure:
  User → [Posts] → [Comments] → [Likes]

Deletion approach:
  1. Delete User → tombstone ts=1000
  2. Propagate tombstone to Posts (ts=1001)
  3. Propagate tombstone to Comments (ts=1002)
  4. Propagate tombstone to Likes (ts=1003)

Invariant: child.deletion_ts > parent.deletion_ts

Query handling:
  - Check tombstone before returning any record
  - Lazy cleanup: compact tombstones during compaction
  - Tombstone TTL: 10-30 days typical
```

**Strategy 3: Compensation Actions**
```
Saga pattern for deletion:
  DeleteUser saga {
    T1: DeleteUserRecord()
    C1: RestoreUserRecord()  // Compensation

    T2: DeleteUserPosts()
    C2: RestoreUserPosts()

    T3: DeleteUserSessions()
    C3: RestoreUserSessions()
  }

Failure handling:
  - If T2 fails → execute C1, abort
  - If T3 fails → execute C2, C1, abort
  - All-or-nothing semantics (eventual)
```

#### 1.2.2 Cross-Service Deletion

**Event-Driven Deletion**
```
Architecture:
  Service A (owns User data)
    │
    ├─► Event Bus (Kafka/Kinesis)
    │
    ├─► Service B (owns Posts)
    ├─► Service C (owns Comments)
    └─► Service D (owns Analytics)

Deletion event:
{
  "event_type": "user.deleted",
  "user_id": "123",
  "deletion_timestamp": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z",
  "deletion_hlc": "1727697600.000000001",
  "idempotency_key": "del-123-20250930"
}

Subscriber guarantees:
  - At-least-once delivery
  - Idempotent deletion handlers
  - Ordered processing per user_id (partition key)
```

**Deletion Workflow:**
```
1. Service A publishes deletion event
   - Writes to local WAL first
   - Publishes to event bus
   - Marks user as "deletion_pending"

2. Services B, C, D subscribe and process
   - Each maintains deletion offset
   - Processes deletions independently
   - Publishes completion events

3. Service A aggregates completions
   - Waits for all subscribers
   - Timeout = 7 days (configurable)
   - After timeout: force complete or alert

4. Final cleanup
   - Hard delete user record
   - Delete from backups
   - Update audit logs
```

### 1.3 Global Retention Policies

#### 1.3.1 Policy Definition

**Multi-Tier Retention Model**
```
Data classification:
  ├─ Hot data: 0-30 days (SSD, multi-region)
  ├─ Warm data: 31-365 days (SSD/HDD, single-region)
  ├─ Cold data: 366-2555 days (Object storage, archive)
  └─ Frozen data: 2556+ days (Glacier, compliance)

Retention rules:
{
  "policy_id": "user_activity",
  "data_types": ["page_views", "clicks", "sessions"],
  "retention_tiers": [
    {"tier": "hot", "duration_days": 30, "storage": "cassandra"},
    {"tier": "warm", "duration_days": 335, "storage": "s3_standard"},
    {"tier": "cold", "duration_days": 2190, "storage": "s3_glacier"}
  ],
  "deletion_method": "hard_delete",
  "encryption_required": true
}
```

**Legal Hold Implementation**
```
Override mechanism:
  - Legal holds override standard retention
  - Per-entity or per-dataset holds
  - Immutable once applied
  - Requires explicit release

Data structure:
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "legal_holds": [
    {
      "hold_id": "case-2024-789",
      "applied_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "applied_by": "legal@company.com",
      "reason": "Litigation - Case #789",
      "release_condition": "manual_review"
    }
  ],
  "retention_policy": "user_data_7year",
  "effective_retention": "indefinite" // Due to legal hold
}

Deletion logic:
  if (has_active_legal_hold(record)) {
    return SKIP_DELETION;
  }
  if (current_time > record.expiry_time) {
    return DELETE;
  }
```

#### 1.3.2 Distributed Policy Enforcement

**Policy Distribution Architecture**
```
                [Policy Control Plane]
                         |
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        │                │                │
    [Region A]       [Region B]      [Region C]
        │                │                │
   [Policy Cache]   [Policy Cache]  [Policy Cache]
        │                │                │
   [Enforcement]    [Enforcement]   [Enforcement]
```

**Policy Consistency Model:**
```
1. Policy changes are eventually consistent
   - Propagation time: <60 seconds
   - Version vectors track policy versions
   - Monotonic reads guaranteed

2. Conservative enforcement during transition
   - If policy_version_unknown: apply strictest rule
   - Grace period: 24 hours after policy change
   - No data loss during policy updates

3. Audit trail requirements
   - Log all policy applications
   - Record policy version used
   - Track deletion decisions
```

## 2. Right-to-be-Forgotten Implementation

### 2.1 Legal Requirements Analysis

#### 2.1.1 GDPR Article 17 Compliance

**Deletion Scope Definition**
```
Personal data categories:
  ├─ Directly identifying:
  │   - Name, email, phone, SSN
  │   - Photos, biometrics
  │   - IP addresses (in some contexts)
  │
  ├─ Indirectly identifying:
  │   - User preferences
  │   - Location history
  │   - Device fingerprints
  │
  └─ Derived/inferred:
      - ML model predictions
      - Behavioral profiles
      - Recommendation history

Deletion requirements per category:
  - Direct: Must hard delete within 30 days
  - Indirect: Anonymize or delete
  - Derived: Delete or re-compute without user data
```

**Exemptions and Edge Cases**
```
Legal bases for retention:
  1. Compliance with legal obligation
     - Tax records: 7 years
     - Financial transactions: 5-10 years
     - Medical records: varies by jurisdiction

  2. Exercise/defense of legal claims
     - Ongoing litigation
     - Regulatory investigations

  3. Public interest/archival purposes
     - Scientific research
     - Statistical purposes
     - Historical archives

Implementation:
  - Tag data with retention_basis
  - Separate deletable vs. non-deletable data
  - Maintain deletion audit trail
```

#### 2.1.2 CCPA/CPRA Compliance

**Consumer Data Rights**
```
Right to Delete (CCPA §1798.105):
  - Business must delete and direct service providers to delete
  - 45-day response window
  - Verification required before deletion

Implementation differences from GDPR:
  ┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
  │ Aspect          │ GDPR         │ CCPA         │
  ├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
  │ Response time   │ 30 days      │ 45 days      │
  │ Scope           │ All personal │ Sold data    │
  │ Verification    │ Identity     │ 2-3 pieces   │
  │ Service provider│ Must delete  │ Must delete  │
  │ Exemptions      │ 6 categories │ 11 categories│
  └─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Technical Implementation Patterns

#### 2.2.1 Deletion Request Processing

**Request Intake and Verification**
```
Deletion request flow:

1. Request submission
   POST /api/v1/privacy/delete-request
   {
     "user_id": "123",
     "verification_method": "email_token",
     "verification_proof": "token_abc123",
     "requested_at": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z"
   }

2. Identity verification
   - Email verification: Send unique token
   - Knowledge-based: Ask security questions
   - Account access: Require login with MFA

3. Request validation
   - Check for legal holds
   - Verify deletion eligibility
   - Calculate deletion scope

4. Request queuing
   - Priority queue based on regulation
   - GDPR: high priority (30 days)
   - CCPA: normal priority (45 days)
   - Queue to avoid thundering herd
```

**Deletion Workflow State Machine**
```
States:
  SUBMITTED → Verification pending
  VERIFIED → Identity confirmed
  SCHEDULED → Queued for processing
  IN_PROGRESS → Actively deleting
  COMPLETED → All systems deleted
  FAILED → Requires manual intervention

Transitions:
  SUBMITTED --verify--> VERIFIED
  VERIFIED --queue--> SCHEDULED
  SCHEDULED --process--> IN_PROGRESS
  IN_PROGRESS --success--> COMPLETED
  IN_PROGRESS --failure--> FAILED
  FAILED --retry--> SCHEDULED

State storage:
  - Replicated across regions
  - Strongly consistent reads
  - Audit trail immutable
```

#### 2.2.2 Cross-System Deletion Orchestration

**Choreography vs Orchestration**

**Approach 1: Saga Orchestrator**
```
Orchestrator service:
  - Centralized deletion coordinator
  - Maintains deletion state machine
  - Handles timeouts and retries
  - Aggregates completion status

Orchestration flow:
  1. Orchestrator receives deletion request
  2. Broadcasts to all data-owning services
  3. Collects acknowledgments
  4. Monitors progress
  5. Handles failures with compensations
  6. Marks complete when all done

Advantages:
  + Clear ownership and visibility
  + Easy to add new systems
  + Centralized monitoring

Disadvantages:
  - Single point of failure
  - Orchestrator must know all systems
  - Coupling between orchestrator and services
```

**Approach 2: Event Choreography**
```
Event-driven approach:
  - Each service subscribes to deletion events
  - Services publish completion events
  - No central coordinator
  - Eventual consistency

Event flow:
  User Service publishes:
    → user.deletion.requested (user_id=123)

  Services consume and process:
    Posts Service → deletes posts → publishes user.deletion.posts.complete
    Comments Service → deletes comments → publishes user.deletion.comments.complete
    Analytics Service → deletes logs → publishes user.deletion.analytics.complete

  Completion Aggregator:
    - Subscribes to all completion events
    - Tracks completion per user_id
    - Marks deletion complete when all services done

Advantages:
  + Decoupled services
  + Scalable
  + Resilient to individual service failures

Disadvantages:
  - Harder to debug
  - No global timeout mechanism
  - Completion detection complexity
```

**Production Pattern: Hybrid Approach**
```
Lightweight orchestrator + event choreography:

1. Orchestrator responsibilities:
   - Request intake and verification
   - Deadline tracking (30/45 days)
   - Completion aggregation
   - Escalation on timeout

2. Service responsibilities:
   - Subscribe to deletion events
   - Process deletions independently
   - Publish progress events
   - Handle retries locally

3. Communication:
   - Orchestrator → Event bus → Services (fan-out)
   - Services → Event bus → Orchestrator (progress)
   - Orchestrator maintains timeout watchers
```

#### 2.2.3 Backup and Archive Deletion

**Challenge: Immutable Backups**
```
Problem: Traditional backups are append-only/immutable
  - Tape backups cannot be selectively deleted
  - Snapshot backups contain point-in-time data
  - Incremental backups may span months

Solutions:

Approach 1: Re-encrypt with Key Rotation
  - Encrypt PII with per-user keys
  - Delete user key → data unrecoverable
  - Backup remains intact structurally
  - Cryptographic deletion (see §3.1)

Approach 2: Tombstone in Restore Process
  - Keep backups immutable
  - Maintain deletion log separately
  - During restore: filter deleted users
  - Deletion log must be durable

Approach 3: Periodic Full Backups
  - Take fresh full backups regularly
  - Apply deletions before backup
  - Expire old backups containing deleted data
  - Retention period = backup_cycle + grace_period
```

**Implementation Example:**
```
Backup deletion workflow:

1. Record deletion in deletion log
   DELETE_LOG.append({
     user_id: 123,
     deleted_at: 2025-09-30T12:00:00Z,
     deleted_hlc: 1727697600.000000001
   })

2. Mark backup segments containing user
   BACKUP_METADATA.mark_deleted({
     user_id: 123,
     affected_backups: [
       "daily-2025-09-01",
       "weekly-2025-09-07",
       "monthly-2025-09-01"
     ]
   })

3. For each backup type:
   a. Daily: expires naturally (7 days)
   b. Weekly: expires naturally (4 weeks)
   c. Monthly: expires naturally (12 months)
   d. Yearly: apply crypto-deletion or re-snapshot

4. Verification:
   - After all affected backups expired
   - Test restore and confirm user absent
   - Update deletion audit trail
```

**Disaster Recovery Considerations**
```
Scenario: Restore from backup after deletion

Timeline:
  t=0:   User requests deletion
  t=1d:  Deletion processed in production
  t=10d: Disaster requiring restore from backup
  t=11d: Restore completes, deleted user resurfaces!

Prevention mechanisms:

1. Deletion log replication
   - Store deletion log separately from main backups
   - Replicate to all backup regions
   - Apply during restore process

2. Point-in-time restore awareness
   - Restore to time T
   - Apply deletion log for deletions during [T, now]
   - User data may briefly exist but immediately deleted

3. Post-restore reconciliation
   - After any restore, run deletion reconciliation
   - Compare production deletion log vs. restored data
   - Re-apply all deletions from log
```

## 3. Encryption At Rest and In Transit

### 3.1 Encryption At Rest

#### 3.1.1 Encryption Layers

**Block Device Encryption**
```
Implementation: LUKS, dm-crypt, BitLocker

Advantages:
  + Transparent to application
  + Full disk encryption
  + Protects against physical theft

Disadvantages:
  - Key available to OS
  - No per-user/per-tenant isolation
  - Cannot selectively delete data

Use cases:
  - Compliance checkbox (encrypt at rest)
  - Protection against disk disposal
  - Physical security requirements
```

**File System Encryption**
```
Implementation: eCryptfs, EncFS, fscrypt

Advantages:
  + Per-directory keys possible
  + File-level granularity
  + Integrates with OS permissions

Disadvantages:
  - Performance overhead (10-30%)
  - Key management complexity
  - Limited cloud provider support

Use cases:
  - Multi-tenant systems
  - Per-user home directories
  - PII isolation
```

**Application-Level Encryption**
```
Implementation: Encrypt before writing to storage

Architecture:
  Application
      ↓
  [Encryption Layer]
      ↓ (ciphertext)
  Database/Storage
      ↓ (ciphertext)
  Block Storage

Advantages:
  + Granular key management
  + Selective encryption
  + Cryptographic deletion
  + Works across storage backends

Disadvantages:
  - Cannot index encrypted fields
  - No range queries on encrypted data
  - Key distribution complexity

Use cases:
  - Sensitive PII (SSN, credit cards)
  - Medical records
  - Financial data
```

#### 3.1.2 Key Management Architecture

**Hierarchical Key Structure**
```
Key hierarchy:

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Master Key (HSM/KMS)        │  ← Rotated yearly
│   - Never leaves secure     │
│   - Used to encrypt KEKs    │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               │
        ┌──────┴──────┐
        ↓             ↓
┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
│ KEK (Region) │ │ KEK (Tenant) │  ← Rotated monthly
│  - Regional  │ │  - Per-tenant│
│  - Encrypts  │ │  - Encrypts  │
│    DEKs      │ │    DEKs      │
└──────┬───────┘ └──────┬───────┘
       │                │
    ┌──┴──┐          ┌──┴──┐
    ↓     ↓          ↓     ↓
 ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
 │ DEK │ │ DEK │  │ DEK │ │ DEK │  ← Rotated per-use
 │(DB) │ │(Log)│  │(User)│ │(Obj)│     or per-resource
 └─────┘ └─────┘  └─────┘ └─────┘
```

**Key Rotation Strategies**
```
Strategy 1: Re-encrypt on rotation
  - Generate new key version
  - Re-encrypt all data with new key
  - Delete old key after re-encryption complete

  Pros: Clean, old keys truly gone
  Cons: Expensive, requires downtime/throttling

Strategy 2: Versioned keys
  - Generate new key version
  - New writes use new key
  - Old data remains encrypted with old key
  - Record key version with each record

  Pros: Zero downtime, efficient
  Cons: Must maintain old keys indefinitely

Strategy 3: Lazy re-encryption
  - Generate new key version
  - Re-encrypt on read/write
  - Background job re-encrypts cold data
  - Hybrid approach

  Pros: Balanced performance
  Cons: Complex implementation

Production example (AWS KMS model):
  - Master keys rotated automatically (yearly)
  - Data keys generated per-record
  - Envelope encryption pattern
  - Key version stored with ciphertext
```

**Envelope Encryption Pattern**
```
Encryption flow:

1. Application requests encryption
   → Generate DEK (256-bit AES key)
   → Encrypt data with DEK
   → Encrypt DEK with KEK (via KMS)
   → Store: ciphertext + encrypted_DEK + key_version

2. Storage format:
   {
     "ciphertext": "base64_encrypted_data",
     "encrypted_dek": "base64_kms_encrypted_key",
     "key_id": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123:key/abc",
     "key_version": "2",
     "encryption_context": {
       "user_id": "123",
       "purpose": "user_profile"
     }
   }

3. Decryption flow:
   → Read record from storage
   → Send encrypted_DEK to KMS
   → KMS decrypts DEK using current key_version
   → Decrypt ciphertext with DEK
   → Return plaintext

Advantages:
  - DEK never leaves application memory unencrypted
  - Each record can have unique DEK
  - KMS only stores KEK, not billions of DEKs
  - Cryptographic deletion: delete DEK from KMS
```

#### 3.1.3 Performance Optimization

**Hardware Acceleration**
```
CPU instructions:
  - AES-NI (x86): 5-10x speedup for AES
  - ARMv8 Crypto Extensions: similar gains
  - Negligible overhead with HW acceleration

Benchmark (AES-256-GCM, single core):
  Software:     ~500 MB/s
  AES-NI:       ~3-5 GB/s
  Overhead:     ~5-10% with HW acceleration

Implementation:
  - Use OpenSSL/BoringSSL (auto-detects HW)
  - Verify CPUID flags at runtime
  - Fallback to software if HW unavailable
```

**Caching Strategies**
```
Problem: KMS calls add latency

Solution 1: DEK caching
  - Cache decrypted DEKs in memory
  - TTL: 5-15 minutes
  - Cache size: 10k-100k keys
  - Eviction: LRU

  Latency improvement:
    No cache:    KMS call = 10-50ms per decrypt
    With cache:  Cache hit = <1ms
    Cache hit rate: 95%+ for hot data

Solution 2: Batch key operations
  - Fetch multiple DEKs in single KMS call
  - Pre-warm cache for predictable access
  - Useful for batch processing

Security considerations:
  - Cached keys vulnerable if memory dumped
  - Use memory protection (mlock, guard pages)
  - Implement cache key rotation
  - Monitor cache metrics for anomalies
```

### 3.2 Encryption In Transit

#### 3.2.1 TLS Configuration

**TLS Version Selection**
```
Supported versions (2025):

┌─────────┬────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Version │ Status │ Use Case    │ Support      │
├─────────┼────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┤
│ TLS 1.0 │ BANNED │ Legacy      │ Disable      │
│ TLS 1.1 │ BANNED │ Legacy      │ Disable      │
│ TLS 1.2 │ OK     │ Broad compat│ Enable       │
│ TLS 1.3 │ PREFER │ Modern      │ Prefer       │
└─────────┴────────┴─────────────┴──────────────┘

Configuration (OpenSSL):
  MinProtocol = TLSv1.2
  MaxProtocol = TLSv1.3
```

**Cipher Suite Selection**
```
Recommended cipher suites (TLS 1.3):
  1. TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
  2. TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  3. TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

Rationale:
  - AEAD ciphers only (no CBC mode)
  - Forward secrecy (ephemeral keys)
  - Hardware acceleration available
  - Resistant to timing attacks

For TLS 1.2 (backward compatibility):
  1. ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
  2. ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
  3. ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305

Avoid:
  - RC4: Broken
  - 3DES: Weak (64-bit block size)
  - CBC mode: Vulnerable to padding oracles
  - Export ciphers: Intentionally weak
  - Anonymous DH: No authentication
```

**Certificate Management**
```
Certificate lifecycle:

1. Issuance
   - Use ACME protocol (Let's Encrypt, etc.)
   - Automated certificate generation
   - 90-day validity (recommended)
   - SAN certificates for multiple domains

2. Deployment
   - Store private keys in HSM/KMS
   - Distribute certificates via config management
   - Implement OCSP stapling
   - Configure certificate pinning (carefully)

3. Rotation
   - Auto-renewal at 60-75% of validity
   - Zero-downtime rotation
   - Overlap period: 7-14 days
   - Monitor expiration alerts

4. Revocation
   - Immediate revocation for compromise
   - Update CRL and OCSP responders
   - Alert all services to refresh
   - Implement certificate transparency logs
```

#### 3.2.2 mTLS for Service-to-Service

**Service Mesh mTLS**
```
Architecture (Istio/Linkerd model):

Application pods:
  [App Container] ←→ [Sidecar Proxy]
                           ↓ mTLS
                           ↓
  [Sidecar Proxy] ←→ [App Container]

mTLS features:
  - Automatic certificate provisioning
  - Transparent to application
  - Identity-based authorization
  - Per-service metrics

Certificate issuance:
  - Short-lived certificates (1-24 hours)
  - Automatic rotation
  - SPIFFE identity format:
    spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/myservice
```

**mTLS Performance Optimization**
```
TLS handshake cost:
  - Full handshake: 1-2 RTTs + crypto (5-20ms)
  - Session resumption: 1 RTT (1-5ms)
  - TLS 1.3 0-RTT: 0 RTT (best case)

Optimization strategies:

1. Connection pooling
   - Keep-alive connections
   - Pool size: 50-500 connections per host
   - Idle timeout: 60-300 seconds
   - Max lifetime: 30-60 minutes (for key rotation)

2. Session resumption
   - Session tickets (TLS 1.2+)
   - Session IDs (older)
   - Resume rate: 80-95% in practice

3. TLS 1.3 0-RTT (use carefully)
   - Replay attack risk
   - Only for idempotent requests
   - Anti-replay mechanisms required

4. Hardware offload
   - TLS termination proxies
   - Dedicated crypto accelerators
   - CPU AES-NI instructions

Benchmarks (per connection):
  No TLS:           0.1ms setup
  TLS 1.2 full:     5-20ms setup
  TLS 1.2 resume:   1-5ms setup
  TLS 1.3 full:     1-10ms setup
  TLS 1.3 0-RTT:    0.5-2ms setup
```

#### 3.2.3 End-to-End Encryption

**Threat Model**
```
Attack scenarios:

1. Compromised intermediate node
   - Solution: E2E encryption from client to storage
   - Application-level encryption

2. Malicious cloud provider
   - Solution: Client-side encryption
   - Keys never reach provider

3. Insider threat
   - Solution: Per-user encryption keys
   - Separation of duties

E2E encryption architecture:

Client Device
    ↓ (Encrypt with client_key)
[Load Balancer]
    ↓ (TLS terminated, but content encrypted)
[Application Server]
    ↓ (Cannot decrypt, content still encrypted)
[Database]
    ↓ (Stores encrypted content)
[Storage]

Only client and authorized recipients can decrypt
```

**Key Exchange Protocols**
```
Signal Protocol (for messaging):
  - Double Ratchet algorithm
  - Forward secrecy
  - Future secrecy (break-in recovery)
  - Deniability

Implementation pattern:
  1. Long-term identity keys
  2. Ephemeral DH key exchange
  3. Symmetric ratchet for messages
  4. Asymmetric ratchet for sessions

Wire Protocol example:
{
  "encrypted_message": "base64_ciphertext",
  "ratchet_public_key": "base64_ephemeral_key",
  "previous_chain_length": 42,
  "message_number": 7
}
```

## 4. Deletion Verification

### 4.1 Provable Deletion

#### 4.1.1 Cryptographic Deletion

**Concept and Implementation**
```
Principle: Make data unrecoverable by destroying encryption key

Process:
  1. Encrypt sensitive data with unique DEK
  2. Store DEK separately (KMS, HSM)
  3. Delete DEK securely
  4. Data becomes cryptographically unrecoverable

Verification:
  - Prove key no longer exists in KMS
  - KMS audit log shows key deletion
  - Ciphertext without key = random bits

Example (AWS KMS):
  1. Create customer managed key (CMK)
     → arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/key-id

  2. Encrypt user data with CMK
     → Store encrypted data + key ARN

  3. Schedule key deletion (7-30 day wait)
     → ScheduleKeyDeletion(KeyId, PendingWindowInDays)

  4. After pending window:
     → Key permanently deleted
     → Data unrecoverable
     → KMS logs prove deletion
```

**Limitations and Considerations**
```
Challenges:

1. Backup copies
   - Encrypted backups remain
   - Must also delete key from backup systems
   - Ensure backup restoration doesn't resurrect keys

2. Key caching
   - Application may cache decrypted keys
   - Must invalidate all caches
   - Restart services that cached keys

3. Key material copies
   - Keys in memory dumps
   - Keys in swap space
   - Keys in application logs (accidental)

4. Legal evidence
   - Proving key deletion ≠ proving data deletion
   - Some regulations require data destruction proof
   - Cryptographic deletion may not satisfy all laws

Production approach:
  - Combine cryptographic + physical deletion
  - Crypto deletion for immediate effect
  - Physical deletion during next compaction
  - Document both methods in audit trail
```

#### 4.1.2 Tamper-Evident Deletion Logs

**Append-Only Deletion Log**
```
Structure:
  - Immutable log of all deletions
  - Signed entries (prevent modification)
  - Merkle tree for efficient verification
  - Distributed across regions

Log entry format:
{
  "sequence_number": 12345,
  "user_id": "123",
  "deletion_type": "right_to_be_forgotten",
  "requested_at": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-10-15T08:30:00Z",
  "systems_deleted": [
    {"system": "user_db", "confirmed_at": "2025-10-15T08:00:00Z"},
    {"system": "analytics_db", "confirmed_at": "2025-10-15T08:15:00Z"},
    {"system": "backup_s3", "confirmed_at": "2025-10-15T08:30:00Z"}
  ],
  "verification_hash": "sha256_of_deletion_proof",
  "signature": "ed25519_signature",
  "previous_entry_hash": "sha256_of_entry_12344"
}

Merkle tree structure:
  - Leaf nodes = individual deletion entries
  - Internal nodes = hash(left_child || right_child)
  - Root hash = commitment to entire log
  - Efficient proofs of inclusion
```

**Verification Protocol**
```
Verification query:
  "Was user_id=123 deleted after date D?"

Proof generation:
  1. Find deletion entry for user_id=123
  2. Generate Merkle proof (log2(N) hashes)
  3. Include signatures and timestamps
  4. Return proof + root hash

Proof verification (by auditor):
  1. Verify Merkle proof → entry in log
  2. Verify signature → entry authentic
  3. Check timestamp → deletion after D
  4. Check completion → all systems deleted

Proof size: O(log N) where N = total deletions
Verification time: O(log N) hash computations
```

### 4.2 Practical Deletion Verification

#### 4.2.1 Multi-System Verification

**Deletion Checklist Approach**
```
System inventory:

1. Primary databases
   ┌─────────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
   │ System              │ Verification │ SLA          │
   ├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
   │ PostgreSQL (users)  │ SELECT count │ 24 hours     │
   │ Cassandra (logs)    │ Scan token   │ 7 days       │
   │ Redis (sessions)    │ KEYS pattern │ 1 hour       │
   └─────────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘

2. Search indices
   - Elasticsearch: refresh + query
   - Solr: commit + query
   - Verification delay: up to indexing lag

3. Caches
   - Invalidate all cache entries
   - May require cache flush
   - Verification: cache miss after flush

4. Object storage
   - S3: list objects with prefix
   - Verification: 0 objects returned
   - Consider versioning

5. Backups and archives
   - Mark in deletion log
   - Verify expiry date set
   - Confirm deletion after retention

Verification query per system:
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM table
  WHERE user_id = 123;

  Expected result: 0
```

**Automated Verification Pipeline**
```
Pipeline stages:

Stage 1: Immediate verification (t+1 hour)
  - Check primary databases
  - Verify cache invalidation
  - Confirm session termination

Stage 2: Replication verification (t+24 hours)
  - Check all regional replicas
  - Verify cross-region consistency
  - Confirm CDC sinks processed

Stage 3: Backup verification (t+30 days)
  - Verify deletion markers applied
  - Check backup metadata
  - Confirm no resurrection risk

Stage 4: Final audit (t+90 days)
  - Comprehensive system scan
  - Generate deletion certificate
  - Archive audit trail

Automation example:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Deletion verification script

USER_ID=$1
DELETION_DATE=$2

# Verify primary DB
PRIMARY_COUNT=$(psql -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE id=${USER_ID}")
if [ "$PRIMARY_COUNT" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "FAIL: User still in primary DB (count=${PRIMARY_COUNT})"
  exit 1
fi

# Verify replicas (all regions)
for REGION in us-east-1 us-west-2 eu-west-1; do
  REPLICA_COUNT=$(psql -h replica.${REGION} -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE id=${USER_ID}")
  if [ "$REPLICA_COUNT" -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "FAIL: User still in ${REGION} replica"
    exit 1
  fi
done

# Verify S3 objects
S3_COUNT=$(aws s3 ls s3://user-data/${USER_ID}/ --recursive | wc -l)
if [ "$S3_COUNT" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "FAIL: User data still in S3 (count=${S3_COUNT})"
  exit 1
fi

# Verify Elasticsearch
ES_COUNT=$(curl -s "http://es:9200/users/_count?q=user_id:${USER_ID}" | jq '.count')
if [ "$ES_COUNT" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "FAIL: User still in Elasticsearch"
  exit 1
fi

echo "PASS: User ${USER_ID} successfully deleted from all systems"
exit 0
```

#### 4.2.2 Sampling and Spot Checks

**Statistical Verification**
```
Challenge: Verifying billions of deletions is expensive

Approach: Sampling-based verification

Sampling strategy:
  - Population: All deletion requests in time period T
  - Sample size: n = (Z²  × p × (1-p)) / E²
    where:
      Z = 1.96 (95% confidence)
      p = 0.5 (worst case)
      E = 0.05 (5% margin of error)

    n = 384 samples for 95% confidence, 5% error

  - Sampling method: Stratified random sampling
    Strata:
      - Deletion type (GDPR, CCPA, user-initiated)
      - System complexity (simple, complex)
      - Time period (daily, weekly, monthly)

Verification process:
  1. Select random sample of 384 deletions
  2. Run full verification on each
  3. Calculate success rate
  4. If success rate < 95%, escalate
  5. Investigate failures systematically

Example:
  Total deletions in September: 10,000
  Sample size: 384
  Verified: 380 complete, 4 incomplete
  Success rate: 98.96%
  Conclusion: Process working correctly
  Action: Investigate 4 failures individually
```

**Continuous Monitoring**
```
Real-time verification metrics:

1. Deletion request rate
   - Requests per second
   - Peak vs. average
   - Anomaly detection (sudden spikes)

2. Deletion completion time
   - P50, P95, P99 latency
   - SLA: 95% complete within 30 days
   - Alert on SLA violations

3. Deletion success rate
   - Successful completions / total requests
   - Target: >99.9%
   - Broken down by system

4. System-specific metrics
   - Per-database deletion lag
   - Replication delay impact
   - Backup deletion backlog

Dashboard example (Prometheus/Grafana):
  deletion_requests_total{regulation="gdpr"}
  deletion_completion_seconds{quantile="0.95"}
  deletion_failures_total{system="cassandra"}
  deletion_backlog{system="backups"}

Alerting rules:
  - Alert: DeletionSLAViolation
    If: deletion_completion_seconds{quantile="0.95"} > 2592000  # 30 days
    Severity: High

  - Alert: DeletionFailureRateHigh
    If: rate(deletion_failures_total[5m]) > 0.001
    Severity: Critical
```

## 5. GDPR/CCPA Compliance Patterns

### 5.1 Data Inventory and Classification

#### 5.1.1 Automated Discovery

**Schema-Based Discovery**
```
Approach: Scan database schemas for PII patterns

Detection rules:
  Column name patterns:
    - email, e_mail, email_address
    - phone, phone_number, mobile
    - ssn, social_security, tax_id
    - address, street_address, postal_code
    - first_name, last_name, full_name
    - dob, date_of_birth, birth_date

  Column type patterns:
    - VARCHAR(email format)
    - CHAR(10) or CHAR(11) [phone]
    - CHAR(9) [SSN]

  Content validation:
    - Regex match email format
    - Luhn algorithm for credit cards
    - Phone number validation
    - SSN format validation

Implementation (SQL):
```
-- Discover PII columns
SELECT
  table_schema,
  table_name,
  column_name,
  data_type,
  CASE
    WHEN column_name ~* 'email' THEN 'PII:email'
    WHEN column_name ~* 'phone|mobile' THEN 'PII:phone'
    WHEN column_name ~* 'ssn|social_security' THEN 'PII:ssn'
    WHEN column_name ~* 'address|street|postal' THEN 'PII:address'
    WHEN column_name ~* 'name' THEN 'PII:name'
    ELSE 'non-PII'
  END AS classification
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
  AND (column_name ~* 'email|phone|ssn|address|name')
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
```

**Content-Based Discovery**
```
Approach: Scan actual data for PII patterns

Sample-based scanning:
  - Sample 1000 random rows per table
  - Apply regex patterns to detect PII
  - Calculate confidence score

PII detection library example:
```python
import re
from typing import List, Dict

class PIIDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = {
            'email': re.compile(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'),
            'phone': re.compile(r'\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b'),
            'ssn': re.compile(r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b'),
            'credit_card': re.compile(r'\b\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}\b'),
            'ip_address': re.compile(r'\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b'),
        }

    def scan_value(self, value: str) -> List[str]:
        """Returns list of detected PII types"""
        detected = []
        for pii_type, pattern in self.patterns.items():
            if pattern.search(value):
                detected.append(pii_type)
        return detected

    def scan_table(self, table_data: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        """Scan sample of table rows"""
        results = {}
        for row in table_data:
            for column, value in row.items():
                if column not in results:
                    results[column] = {'pii_types': set(), 'confidence': 0}

                if value and isinstance(value, str):
                    detected = self.scan_value(value)
                    if detected:
                        results[column]['pii_types'].update(detected)
                        results[column]['confidence'] += 1

        # Calculate confidence percentage
        for column in results:
            results[column]['confidence'] = (
                results[column]['confidence'] / len(table_data) * 100
            )
            results[column]['pii_types'] = list(results[column]['pii_types'])

        return results
```

#### 5.1.2 Classification Taxonomy

Classification metadata:
{
  "database": "users_db",
  "table": "users",
  "column": "email",
  "classification": {
    "level": 4,
    "category": "PII:email",
    "regulations": ["GDPR", "CCPA", "PIPEDA"],
    "retention_days": 2555,  # 7 years
    "deletion_method": "hard_delete",
    "encryption_required": true,
    "access_log_required": true,
    "export_allowed": true
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Consent Management

#### 5.2.1 Consent Storage Model

**Consent Record Structure**
```
Consent schema:
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "consent_id": "consent-2025-09-30-abc123",
  "consent_version": "v2.1",
  "granted_at": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z",
  "granted_at_hlc": "1727697600.000000001",
  "ip_address": "192.0.2.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",

  "purposes": [
    {
      "purpose_id": "marketing_emails",
      "purpose_name": "Marketing Communications",
      "consented": true,
      "lawful_basis": "consent",  # GDPR Article 6(1)(a)

      "lawful_basis": "legitimate_interest",  # GDPR Article 6(1)(f)
      "granted_at": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z"

    }
  ],

  "expiry_date": "2027-09-30T12:00:00Z",  # Consent expires after 2 years
  "renewal_required": true
}
```

**Consent Propagation**
```
Challenge: Consent must be enforced across all systems

Architecture:

┌──────────────┐
│ Consent API  │  ← Single source of truth
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ├──→ [Event Bus] ──→ consent.granted / consent.withdrawn
       │
       ↓
┌──────────────┐
│ Consent Cache│  ← Distributed cache (Redis)
│ (per region) │     TTL: 5 minutes
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ├──→ [Marketing Service] checks cache before email
       ├──→ [Analytics Service] checks cache before tracking
       ├──→ [Ad Service] checks cache before ad serving
       └──→ [Data Warehouse] filters based on consent

Consistency model:
  - Consent grants: Eventual (few seconds lag acceptable)
  - Consent withdrawals: Urgent (propagate within 1 minute)

Implementation:
  - Consent withdrawal → high-priority event
  - All services subscribe to consent events
  - Services maintain local consent cache
  - Cache invalidation on withdrawal
```

#### 5.2.2 Consent Enforcement

**Query-Time Enforcement**
```
Approach: Check consent at data access time

Example (analytics query):
```sql
-- Without consent enforcement
SELECT user_id, page_views, session_duration
FROM analytics
WHERE date = '2025-09-30';

-- With consent enforcement
SELECT a.user_id, a.page_views, a.session_duration
FROM analytics a
INNER JOIN consent c ON a.user_id = c.user_id
WHERE a.date = '2025-09-30'
  AND c.purpose_id = 'analytics'
  AND c.consented = true
  AND c.expiry_date > NOW();
```

Performance optimization:
  - Materialized consent view
  - Consent bitmap indices
  - Partition by consent status

Filtering approach (application layer):
```python
class ConsentEnforcer:
    def __init__(self, consent_cache):
        self.consent_cache = consent_cache

    def filter_by_consent(self, records: List[Dict], purpose: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Filter records based on consent"""
        user_ids = [r['user_id'] for r in records]
        consents = self.consent_cache.get_many(user_ids)

        filtered = []
        for record in records:
            user_consent = consents.get(record['user_id'])
            if user_consent and user_consent.has_purpose(purpose):
                filtered.append(record)

        return filtered

# Usage
enforcer = ConsentEnforcer(consent_cache)
raw_results = analytics_db.query("SELECT * FROM events WHERE date = ?", date)
filtered_results = enforcer.filter_by_consent(raw_results, purpose='analytics')
```

**Write-Time Enforcement**
```
Approach: Block writes if consent missing

Pre-write validation:
```python
def store_user_event(user_id: str, event: Dict, purpose: str):
    # Check consent before storing
    consent = consent_service.get_consent(user_id, purpose)

    if not consent or not consent.is_valid():
        logger.warning(f"Consent missing for user {user_id}, purpose {purpose}")
        return  # Drop event

    # Store event only if consented
    event_store.write(user_id, event)

    # Tag event with consent metadata
    event['consent_id'] = consent.consent_id
    event['consent_version'] = consent.version
```

Consent metadata in records:
  - Store consent_id with each record
  - Enables retroactive consent audits
  - Proves consent at time of data collection

### 5.3 Cross-Border Data Residency

#### 5.3.1 Data Localization Requirements

**Regional Data Classification**
```
Jurisdiction-specific requirements:

EU (GDPR):
  - Personal data of EU residents
  - May be transferred with safeguards:
    • Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
    • Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
    • Adequacy decisions (UK, Switzerland, etc.)
  - Extra-EEA transfers monitored

China (PIPL):
  - Personal data collected in China
  - Must be stored in China
  - Cross-border transfers require:
    • Security assessment
    • Certification
    • Standard contracts
  - Critical Infrastructure Operators (CIOs): strict localization

Russia (Law 152-FZ):
  - Personal data of Russian citizens
  - Must be stored on servers in Russia
  - Cross-border transfers restricted

India (Draft Data Protection Bill):
  - Sensitive personal data localization
  - Copy must remain in India
  - Cross-border transfers with consent

Approach: Tag users with data residency requirements
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "home_region": "eu-west-1",
  "residency_rules": {
    "primary_storage": "eu-west-1",
    "allowed_regions": ["eu-west-1", "eu-central-1", "uk-west-1"],
    "prohibited_regions": ["us-east-1", "ap-southeast-1"],
    "transfer_mechanism": "SCC",
    "cross_border_consent": true
  }
}
```

#### 5.3.2 Architecture Patterns

**Pattern 1: Region-Locked Data**
```
Architecture:
  - User data stays in home region
  - No cross-region replication
  - Requests routed to home region

┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   EU Users  │     │   US Users  │     │  APAC Users │
│   (home:eu) │     │   (home:us) │     │ (home:apac) │
└──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘
       │                   │                    │
       ↓                   ↓                    ↓

│ (isolated)  │     │ (isolated)  │     │ (isolated)  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘

Advantages:
  + Full compliance by design
  + Clear data boundaries
  + Minimal cross-region traffic

Disadvantages:
  - Higher latency for traveling users
  - No disaster recovery across regions
  - Complex routing logic
```

**Pattern 2: Metadata Replication Only**
```
Architecture:
  - PII stays in home region
  - Non-PII metadata replicated globally
  - Hybrid queries

Global metadata DB:
  - User ID
  - Account status (active/deleted)
  - Home region pointer
  - Non-sensitive preferences

Regional PII DB:
  - Name, email, phone
  - Address, payment info
  - Personal content

Query example:
  1. Check global metadata for user existence
  2. Route to home region for PII
  3. Combine results

┌─────────────────────┐
│  Global Metadata    │  ← Replicated worldwide
│  (user_id, region)  │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
     ┌─────┼─────┐
     ↓     ↓     ↓
  [EU DB][US DB][APAC DB]  ← Region-locked PII
```

**Pattern 3: Encrypted Cross-Border**
```
Architecture:
  - Data replicated for DR
  - Encrypted with region-specific keys
  - Keys only in home region

Flow:
  1. EU user data stored in EU
  2. Encrypted copy replicated to US (for DR)
  3. Encryption key stays in EU KMS
  4. US cannot decrypt without EU KMS call

Compliance:
  - Data present in US (replicated)
  - But unusable without EU key access
  - Satisfies some interpretations of GDPR

┌─────────────┐
│  EU Region  │
│  [KMS Key]  │
│  [Data]     │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Encrypted replication
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  US Region  │
│  [Encrypted]│  ← Cannot decrypt without EU KMS
│  [Data]     │
└─────────────┘
```

#### 5.3.3 Dynamic Region Selection

**User Home Region Assignment**
```
Assignment logic:

1. At registration:
   - Detect user IP geolocation
   - Assign home region based on location
   - Store as immutable (or requires approval to change)

2. Region selection algorithm:
   if user_location in EU_COUNTRIES:
       home_region = "eu-west-1"
   elif user_location in CHINA:
       home_region = "cn-north-1"
   elif user_location in US_STATES:
       home_region = "us-east-1"
   else:
       home_region = "default-region"  # Closest region

3. Override mechanisms:
   - User explicitly selects region
   - Manual review for sensitive jurisdictions
   - Admin override with audit log
```

**Request Routing**
```
Routing strategies:

Approach 1: DNS-based
  - GeoDNS routes to nearest region
  - Each region checks user home region
  - Proxy to home region if needed

Approach 2: Global load balancer
  - L7 load balancer inspects user_id
  - Looks up home region from metadata DB
  - Routes to appropriate region

Approach 3: Service mesh
  - Envoy/Istio routing rules
  - User-region affinity header
  - Automatic retry to home region

Example (Envoy config):
```yaml
route_config:
  virtual_hosts:
  - name: user_service
    domains: ["*"]
    routes:
    - match:
        prefix: "/api/v1/user"
        headers:
        - name: x-user-region
          exact_match: "eu-west-1"
      route:
        cluster: user_service_eu
    - match:
        prefix: "/api/v1/user"
        headers:
        - name: x-user-region
          exact_match: "us-east-1"
      route:
        cluster: user_service_us
```

## 6. Production Playbooks

### 6.1 Data Breach Response

**Detection and Containment**
```
Phase 1: Detection (0-1 hour)
  1. Alert triggers:
     - Unusual data access patterns
     - Unauthorized API calls
     - Database permission escalation
     - Exfiltration anomalies

  2. Immediate actions:
     - Isolate affected systems
     - Revoke suspicious credentials
     - Enable enhanced logging
     - Notify security team

Phase 2: Assessment (1-4 hours)
  1. Determine scope:
     - How many users affected?
     - What data types exposed?
     - How long was access maintained?
     - Was data exfiltrated?

  2. Classify severity:
     Level 1: <100 users, non-sensitive data
     Level 2: 100-10k users, moderate sensitivity
     Level 3: >10k users, highly sensitive data

  3. Document everything:
     - Timeline of events
     - Systems accessed
     - Data accessed
     - Actions taken

Phase 3: Notification (4-72 hours)
  1. Regulatory notification:
     - GDPR: Within 72 hours of detection
     - CCPA: Without unreasonable delay
     - Other: Check local laws

  2. User notification:
     - If high risk to users
     - Provide clear next steps
     - Offer credit monitoring if applicable

  3. Public disclosure:
     - If required by law
     - Coordinate with PR/legal
     - Transparent but measured

Phase 4: Remediation (ongoing)
  1. Close vulnerability
  2. Improve detection

## 7. Implementation Exercises

### Exercise 1: TTL Design for Multi-Region System
**Scenario**: Design a TTL system for session data replicated across 3 regions (US, EU, APAC) with max clock skew of 100ms. Sessions should expire after 30 minutes.

**Requirements**:
- No session should expire early
- Sessions should not persist significantly beyond 30 minutes
- Handle region failures gracefully

**Solution outline**:
1. Use HLC timestamps for session creation
2. Store expiry as `created_hlc + 30min + max_skew`
3. Each region checks expiry independently
4. Tombstones replicated after deletion

### Exercise 2: Right-to-be-Forgotten Implementation
**Scenario**: Implement deletion across:
- PostgreSQL (users table)
- Elasticsearch (search index)
- S3 (user uploads)
- Kafka (event stream)

**Requirements**:
- Verify deletion in all systems
- Generate deletion certificate
- Handle system failures

**Solution outline**:
1. Saga orchestrator for deletion
2. Compensation actions for failures
3. Deletion log for verification
4. Automated verification pipeline

### Exercise 3: Cross-Border Compliance
**Scenario**: Design data architecture for EU and US users with GDPR compliance.

**Requirements**:
- EU user data never leaves EU
- US users have normal multi-region replication
- Traveling EU users can still access their data

**Solution outline**:
1. Tag users with home_region
2. Region-locked storage for EU
3. Global metadata for routing
4. Cross-region proxying for traveling users

## Summary

Data governance and privacy are not afterthoughts but fundamental architectural concerns in distributed systems. Key takeaways:

1. **TTL and Retention**: Use HLC-based TTL for correctness, implement multi-tier retention policies, handle cascading deletion carefully.

2. **Right-to-be-Forgotten**: Requires orchestration across all systems, comprehensive verification, and audit trails. Expect 30-90 day timelines.

3. **Encryption**: Defense in depth—block device, filesystem, and application-level. Envelope encryption for key management. Hardware acceleration essential.

4. **Deletion Verification**: Combine cryptographic deletion (immediate) with physical deletion (eventual). Use tamper-evident logs for audit.

5. **Compliance**: GDPR and CCPA have different requirements but overlapping concerns. Automated compliance monitoring essential at scale.

6. **Data Residency**: Critical for global systems. Choose between region-locking (strict), metadata replication (hybrid), or encrypted cross-border (balanced).

These concerns interact with every distributed systems concept in this book—from replication to consensus to caching. Privacy-by-design is not optional at planet scale.
