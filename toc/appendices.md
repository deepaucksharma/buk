### D.6 Azure Cosmos DB (2025)

#### D.6.1 Architecture Overview
* Multi-model database
  - Document (JSON): primary model
  - Key-value: via Table API
  - Graph: Gremlin API
  - Column-family: Cassandra API compatibility
  - All backed by same ARS (Atom-Record-Sequence) engine
* Multi-master replication
  - Write anywhere: all regions accept writes
  - Conflict resolution: LWW, custom logic, or manual
  - Global distribution: 60+ Azure regions
  - Automatic failover: no manual intervention

#### D.6.2 Five Consistency Levels
* Strong
  - Linearizable: reads see latest committed write
  - Use case: financial transactions, inventory
  - Latency: 2x write regions round-trip
  - Availability: reduced during network partition
* Bounded Staleness
  - Lag bounded by K versions or T seconds
  - Typical: K=100,000 operations or T=5 minutes
  - Use case: leaderboard, social feeds
  - Guarantees: monotonic reads, consistent prefix
* Session
  - Per-session consistency: user sees own writes
  - Default for most applications
  - Implementation: session token propagation
  - Use case: shopping cart, user profile
* Consistent Prefix
  - Reads never see out-of-order writes
  - May see old data, but causality preserved
  - Use case: social media, messaging
* Eventual
  - Weakest, fastest, most available
  - Convergence guaranteed: eventually consistent
  - Use case: cache, analytics, telemetry

#### D.6.3 Performance Characteristics
* Request Units (RU) model
  - 1 RU = 1 KB read at eventual consistency
  - 5 RU = 1 KB read at strong consistency
  - 5 RU = 1 KB write
  - 10 RU = 1 KB indexed write
* Throughput
  - Provisioned: 400-1M RU/sec per container
  - Serverless: pay-per-request, 5000 RU/sec burst
  - Autoscale: dynamic adjustment
* Latency (P99)
  - Single-region read: <10ms
  - Single-region write: <10ms
  - Multi-region strong read: <30ms
  - Multi-region write: <15ms (ack from local region)
* Storage limits
  - Logical partition: 20 GB
  - Physical partition: 50 GB
  - Container: unlimited (auto-partition)

#### D.6.4 Partitioning Strategy
* Partition key selection critical
  - Hot partition: single key exceeds 10K RU/sec
  - Examples of good keys: userId, tenantId, deviceId
  - Examples of bad keys: date (temporal hotspot), status (low cardinality)
* Hierarchical partition keys (2025)
  - Up to 3 levels: [tenant, user, device]
  - Better distribution, co-location of related data
  - Query efficiency: scan within partition hierarchy
* Cross-partition queries
  - Parallel fan-out: query all partitions
  - Cost: sum of RUs across partitions
  - Performance: P99 = slowest partition

#### D.6.5 Multi-Region Writes
* Conflict resolution modes
  - Last-Write-Wins (LWW): highest timestamp wins
  - Custom: user-defined merge procedure
  - Conflict feed: application resolves manually
* Vector clocks implementation
  - Per-region version vector
  - Concurrent writes detected: [R1:5, R2:3] vs [R1:4, R2:4]
  - Resolution: apply policy or invoke custom resolver
* Network topology
  - Full mesh: all regions replicate to all
  - Hub-and-spoke: one primary, others secondary
  - Custom: geo-routing policies

#### D.6.6 Lessons Learned
* Partition key design
  - Over-partition: small keys fragment data
  - Under-partition: hot keys overwhelm single partition
  - Solution: composite keys, hierarchical partitioning
* Consistency vs cost
  - Strong consistency: 2x RU cost
  - Session consistency: sweet spot for most apps
  - Eventual: use only for non-critical data
* Global distribution
  - Add regions incrementally: test failover first
  - Monitor replication lag: set alerts at 1 minute
  - Understand cost: cross-region replication + storage

### D.7 TiDB (2025)

#### D.7.1 Architecture Overview
* MySQL-compatible distributed SQL database
  - Wire protocol: MySQL clients work unmodified
  - SQL dialect: 99% MySQL compatible
  - Ecosystem: works with MySQL tools, ORMs
* Three-layer architecture
  - TiDB Server: stateless SQL layer, query optimization
  - Placement Driver (PD): cluster metadata, timestamp oracle
  - TiKV: distributed transactional key-value store
* Separation of compute and storage
  - Scale TiDB servers independently: horizontal SQL
  - Scale TiKV independently: horizontal storage
  - PD: 3-5 nodes, Raft consensus

#### D.7.2 TiKV: Storage Layer
* Key-value store based on RocksDB
  - Region: 96 MB chunk of key space
  - Raft group per region: 3 replicas default
  - Coprocessor: predicate pushdown to storage
* Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)
  - Key encoding: [user_key, timestamp] → value
  - Read: find latest version <= snapshot_ts
  - Garbage collection: remove old versions
* Percolator transaction model
  - Two-phase commit over Raft
  - Primary lock: single key coordinates transaction
  - Secondary locks: other keys in transaction
  - Commit timestamp: from PD timestamp oracle

#### D.7.3 TiDB SQL Layer
* Stateless SQL parser and optimizer
  - Cost-based optimizer: statistics-driven
  - Distributed execution: push computation to TiKV
  - Streaming results: reduce memory footprint
* Query execution patterns
  - Point query: single region lookup
  - Range scan: parallel across regions
  - Join: hash join, merge join, index join
  - Aggregation: two-phase (partial + final)

#### D.7.4 Placement Driver (PD)
* Responsibilities

  - Metadata: cluster topology, region locations
  - Scheduler: region rebalancing, leader election
  - Monitor: health checks, metrics aggregation
* Timestamp Oracle (TSO)
  - Allocates globally unique, monotonic timestamps
  - Batch allocation: 10K timestamps per request
  - Throughput: 100K+ timestamps/sec
  - Fallback: single PD leader bottleneck

#### D.7.5 Performance Characteristics (2025)
* Throughput
  - OLTP: 50K-200K TPS (3-node cluster)
  - OLAP: columnar storage (TiFlash) 1M+ rows/sec scan
  - Mixed workload: HTAP (Hybrid Transactional/Analytical)
* Latency (P99)
  - Point read: <10ms
  - Point write: <20ms
  - Range scan (1K rows): <50ms
* Scalability
  - Horizontal: add TiDB/TiKV nodes for capacity
  - Vertical: limited by PD TSO (single bottleneck)
  - Max scale (tested): 500+ nodes, 100+ TB

#### D.7.6 Lessons Learned
* TSO bottleneck
  - Single PD leader limits write throughput
  - Solution: batch timestamp allocation
  - Future: local timestamp pools (TiDB 6.0+)
* Region splits and merges
  - Hot regions: automatic split at 96 MB
  - Cold regions: merge after low traffic
  - Split storms: rapid growth causes cascading splits
* MySQL compatibility trade-offs
  - No foreign keys: application-level enforcement
  - Limited triggers: not fully supported
  - Character set: UTF-8 default, collation differences

### D.8 YugabyteDB (2025)

#### D.8.1 Architecture Overview

#### D.8.2 DocDB Storage
* Tablet structure
  - Range partitioning: ordered key ranges
  - Hash partitioning: random distribution
  - Hybrid: hash + range for time-series
* Document model within key-value
  - Key: [table_id, partition_key, clustering_key, timestamp]
  - Value: column_id → column_value (sub-document)
  - Efficient updates: modify sub-document only
* Replication via Raft
  - Leader per tablet: handles writes
  - Followers: replicate via Raft log
  - Read replicas: eventual consistency, read-only

#### D.8.3 Transaction Processing
* Snapshot Isolation by default
  - Read snapshot: consistent view at start_ts
  - Write conflicts: detected at commit time
  - Serializable: optional, via SSI (Serializable Snapshot Isolation)
* Transaction coordinator
  - Distributed transactions: 2PC over Raft
  - Transaction status table: tracks in-flight transactions
  - Heartbeats: keep transactions alive
* Optimizations
  - Single-shard transactions: fast path, no 2PC
  - Read-only transactions: no locking
  - Automatic retries: transient failures

#### D.8.4 Performance Characteristics (2025)
* Throughput

* Xcluster replication
  - Asynchronous cross-cluster replication
  - Use case: disaster recovery, read scaling
  - Lag: typically <1 second
* Global transactions
  - Cross-region commits: high latency (100-200ms)
  - Prefer single-region transactions: design locality

#### D.8.6 Lessons Learned
* PostgreSQL compatibility challenges
  - Extension compatibility: limited pg extensions
  - Performance: not identical to single-node Postgres
  - Migration: schema changes require testing
* Tablet splitting
  - Automatic at 10 GB: pre-split for large tables
  - Split during load: causes latency spikes
  - Recommendation: pre-split hot tables
* Read replicas
  - Staleness: follower lag 100ms-1sec
  - Load balancing: application needs awareness
  - Cost: storage overhead, network replication

### D.9 ScyllaDB and Cassandra (2025)

#### D.9.1 Architecture Overview
* Cassandra: Java-based, tunable consistency
* ScyllaDB: C++ rewrite, API-compatible
  - 10x throughput: single-threaded per core
  - Lower latency: no GC pauses
  - Same data model: CQL, wide-column
* Peer-to-peer topology
  - No leader: all nodes equal
  - Gossip protocol: cluster membership
  - Consistent hashing: data placement

#### D.9.2 Data Model
* Wide-column store
  - Partition key: distribution across nodes
  - Clustering key: sort order within partition
  - Columns: dynamic, schema-optional
* Example
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE timeseries (
    device_id UUID,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    value DOUBLE,
    PRIMARY KEY (device_id, timestamp)
  );
  -- device_id: partition key (distribution)
  -- timestamp: clustering key (sort order)
  ```
* Queries
  - Efficient: single partition read/write
  - Inefficient: multi-partition, secondary index
  - Use case: time-series, IoT, messaging

#### D.9.3 Tunable Consistency
* Replication factor (RF): typically 3
* Consistency levels
  - ONE: fastest, least consistent
  - QUORUM: majority (2/3), balanced
  - ALL: slowest, most consistent
  - LOCAL_QUORUM: same-datacenter majority
* Read repair
  - Sync: repair during read (slower)
  - Async: repair in background
  - Use case: fix inconsistencies
* Hinted handoff
  - Failed writes: store hint on coordinator
  - Replay: when failed node recovers
  - Limitations: 3-hour window

#### D.9.4 Performance Characteristics (2025)
* Cassandra
  - Throughput: 10K-50K writes/sec per node
  - Latency P99: 10-50ms
  - GC pauses: 50-500ms (CMS/G1)
* ScyllaDB
  - Throughput: 100K-1M writes/sec per node

  - No GC pauses: predictable tail latency
* Scalability
  - Linear: 1000+ node clusters
  - Add nodes: automatic rebalancing
  - Multi-datacenter: supported, common

#### D.9.5 Operational Patterns
* Compaction strategies
  - Size-tiered (STCS): write-heavy, read-few
  - Leveled (LCS): read-heavy, reduces latency
  - Time-window (TWCS): time-series, drop old data
* Repair operations
  - Full repair: Merkle tree comparison, expensive
  - Incremental repair: track repaired SSTables
  - Frequency: weekly for RF=3
* Backups
  - Snapshots: hard links to SSTables
  - Incremental: only new SSTables
  - Restore: copy SSTables, restart node

#### D.9.6 Lessons Learned
* Avoid secondary indexes
  - Performance: scatter-gather across cluster
  - Alternative: denormalization, materialized views
* Partition size limits
  - Max recommended: 100 MB per partition
  - Oversize: single-node hotspot, slow reads
  - Solution: redesign partition key
* Consistency tuning
  - QUORUM reads + QUORUM writes: strong consistency
  - ONE reads + ALL writes: fast reads, slow writes
  - Trade-offs: availability vs consistency

### D.10 Negative Case Study: MongoDB Early Durability Issues

#### D.10.1 Historical Context (2009-2012)
* Promise vs reality
  - Marketing: "high performance, scalable database"
  - Reality: default configuration lost data on crash
  - Community backlash: "MongoDB eats your data"
* Technical issues
  - Write concern: default "unacknowledged"
  - Journaling: disabled by default (pre-2.0)
  - Fsync: not called on writes
  - Replication: asynchronous, lossy

#### D.10.2 Specific Failure Modes
* Single-server data loss
  - Scenario: write succeeds, server crashes
  - Outcome: data lost (in memory, not on disk)
  - Reason: no fsync, no journal
* Replication lag data loss
  - Scenario: primary crashes before replication
  - Outcome: last N seconds of writes lost
  - Reason: asynchronous replication, no acknowledgment
* Split-brain without writes
  - Scenario: network partition, two primaries
  - Outcome: conflicting writes, manual reconciliation
  - Reason: no consensus protocol (pre-Raft)

#### D.10.3 Evolution to Safety (2010-2020)
* MongoDB 2.0 (2011): Journaling on by default
  - WAL for single-server durability
  - 100 ms journal flush: tuneable
* MongoDB 3.2 (2015): Write concern majority
  - Application can request durability
  - Still not default: requires explicit setting
* MongoDB 4.0 (2018): Multi-document transactions
  - ACID across collections
  - Snapshot isolation
* MongoDB 4.2 (2019): Distributed transactions
  - Cross-shard ACID
  - Two-phase commit
* MongoDB 5.0 (2021): Default write concern majority
  - Finally: safe by default
  - 12 years after initial release

#### D.10.4 Lessons for Distributed Systems
* Defaults matter
  - Users don't read documentation
  - Unsafe defaults harm reputation
  - Correct-by-default: non-negotiable
* Marketing vs engineering
  - Overpromise: creates backlash
  - Underpromise: builds trust
  - Be honest: acknowledge trade-offs
* Evolutionary vs revolutionary
  - MongoDB evolved over 12 years
  - Could have launched with safety: chose performance
  - Hindsight: safety first, optimize later
* Consensus protocols
  - Raft/Paxos: essential for correctness
  - Custom replication: hard to get right
  - Use proven protocols: don't reinvent

#### D.10.5 Counterfactual: What if MongoDB used Raft from day 1?
* Advantages
  - Strong consistency: no data loss
  - Automatic failover: no manual intervention
  - Trust: better reputation
* Trade-offs
  - Complexity: harder to implement (2009)
  - Performance: slightly slower writes
  - Maturity: Raft formalized in 2014
* Outcome
  - Likely: slower adoption (performance focus)
  - Possible: better long-term success (correctness focus)
  - Actual: competitive pressure led to unsafe defaults

  - Distribution: zipfian, temporal patterns
  - Availability: research repositories

### F.2 Performance Metrics

#### F.2.1 Latency Percentiles
* Why p99/p999 matter
  - Tail latency amplification in microservices
  - Example: 1 request → 100 backend calls
  - If backend p99 = 100ms, frontend p99 = ?
    - P(all 100 < 100ms) = 0.99^100 = 36.6%
    - P(at least one > 100ms) = 63.4%
    - Frontend p50 experiences backend p99!
* Measuring tail latency correctly
  - HDR Histogram: handles full range without loss
  - Coordinated omission problem
    - Wrong: measure time between responses
    - Right: measure time from intended send
  - Example
    ```python
    # Wrong (coordinated omission)
    start = time.now()
    response = send_request()
    latency = time.now() - start  # Misses queued time!

    # Right
    intended_start = time.now()
    actual_start = time.now()  # May be delayed
    response = send_request()
    latency = time.now() - intended_start  # Includes queue time
    ```
* Reporting standards
  - Always report: p50, p99, p999, max
  - Include: throughput, error rate
  - Context: load level, time of day, region
  - Disaggregation: per-operation, per-datacenter

#### F.2.2 Throughput and Scalability
* Throughput measurements
  - Closed-loop: fixed client threads
  - Open-loop: fixed request rate
  - Saturation: max throughput without latency SLO violation
* Scalability metrics
  - Linear: 2x nodes → 2x throughput (ideal)
  - Sublinear: 2x nodes → 1.5x throughput (typical)
  - Superlinear: 2x nodes → 2.5x throughput (rare, caching effects)
  - Negative: 2x nodes → 0.8x throughput (coordination overhead)
* Universal Scalability Law
  ```
  Throughput(N) = λN / (1 + α(N-1) + βN(N-1))
  Where:
    N = number of processors/nodes
    λ = ideal throughput per node
    α = contention coefficient (serialization)
    β = coherency coefficient (communication)
  ```

### F.3 Benchmarking Best Practices

#### F.3.1 Experimental Setup
* Hardware consistency
  - Same instance types: CPU, memory, disk
  - Same network: bandwidth, latency
  - Same configuration: kernel params, file systems
  - Avoid: spot instances, shared tenancy
* Warmup phase
  - Duration: 10-30 minutes minimum
  - Purpose: JIT compilation, cache population
  - Discard: warmup metrics, only report steady-state
* Duration and repetition
  - Minimum: 30 minutes per run
  - Repetitions: 3-5 runs, report median/stdev
  - Detect: performance drift, outlier runs
* Monitoring during benchmark
  - System metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network
  - Application metrics: cache hit rate, GC pauses
  - Bottleneck identification: CPU-bound? IO-bound?

#### F.3.2 Common Pitfalls
* Client-side bottlenecks
  - Symptoms: clients at 100% CPU
  - Solutions: more client threads, distributed clients
  - Verify: server not saturated
* Coordinated omission (repeated)
  - Problem: underestimating latency under load
  - Detection: p999 looks too good
  - Fix: HdrHistogram with coordinated omission correction
* Unrealistic data distribution
  - Problem: uniform distribution, sequential keys
  - Reality: zipfian, temporal locality
  - Impact: unrealistic cache hit rates
* Configuration tuning
  - Problem: comparing default vs tuned systems
  - Fair: either both default or both tuned
  - Document: all configuration changes
* Cherry-picking results
  - Problem: reporting best of 10 runs
  - Integrity: report median, stdev, all runs
  - Anomalies: investigate outliers, don't hide

#### F.3.3 Reporting Standards
* Minimum required information
  - System under test: version, configuration
  - Hardware: CPU, memory, disk, network
  - Benchmark: tool, workload, parameters
  - Results: throughput, latency (p50/p99/p999), errors
  - Duration: warmup, measurement, repetitions
  - Date: when tested (software/hardware changes)
* Reproducibility checklist
  - Configuration files: published
  - Benchmark scripts: published
  - Raw data: available on request
  - Environment: containerized or documented
* Visualization best practices
  - Latency: always use log scale for y-axis
  - Percentiles: show full distribution, not just avg
  - Time series: show duration of test
  - Comparisons: same y-axis scale

### F.4 Datasets for Testing

#### F.4.1 Synthetic Data
* Data generation tools
  - Faker (Python): realistic names, addresses, dates
  - Mockaroo: web-based, CSV/JSON/SQL output
  - Databricks DBGEN: TPC-H/TPC-DS data generator
* Scale considerations
  - Development: 1-10GB (fits in memory)
  - Testing: 100GB-1TB (stress tests)
  - Production-like: 10TB+ (realistic scale)
* Distribution modeling
  - Zipfian: α=0.99 (realistic access patterns)
  - Temporal: recent data accessed more
  - Correlated: related fields have dependencies

#### F.4.2 Real-World Datasets
* Anonymized production data
  - Legal: GDPR, CCPA compliance
  - Techniques: k-anonymity, differential privacy
  - Tools: ARX, Google Differential Privacy library
* Public datasets
  - Wikipedia edits: temporal patterns
  - Stack Overflow: Q&A graph
  - GitHub: code repository metadata
  - Twitter sample: social network
* Academic repositories
  - SNAP (Stanford): large network datasets
  - UCI Machine Learning: classification datasets
  - AWS Open Data: Landsat, weather, genomics

## Appendix G: Outage Postmortems

### G.1 Postmortem Template

#### G.1.1 Structure
* Executive summary
  - Impact: customers affected, duration, revenue loss
  - Root cause: one-sentence technical explanation
  - Resolution: how it was fixed
  - Prevention: how we'll prevent recurrence
* Timeline
  - Detection: when first noticed (automated alert? customer report?)
  - Escalation: who notified, when on-call engaged
  - Investigation: hypotheses tested, dead ends
  - Mitigation: temporary fixes applied
  - Resolution: permanent fix deployed
  - Recovery: when service fully restored
* Impact analysis
  - Quantitative: requests failed, latency impact
  - Qualitative: user experience, reputation
  - Financial: revenue loss, SLA credits
  - Scope: geographic, service, customer segment
* Root cause analysis
  - Immediate cause: what triggered the incident
  - Contributing factors: why did it happen now
  - Underlying causes: why was it possible at all
  - Five whys technique: drill down to root
* Action items
  - Prevention: eliminate root cause
  - Detection: alert faster next time
  - Mitigation: reduce impact when it happens
  - Process: improve incident response
  - Owners: who is responsible for each action
  - Deadlines: when will it be done

#### G.1.2 Blameless Culture
* Principles
  - Human error is inevitable: systems must be resilient
  - Blame hides truth: fear prevents learning
  - Focus on systems: not who, but why was it possible
  - Psychological safety: encourage reporting
* Language guidelines
  - Avoid: "X made a mistake", "Y should have known"
  - Use: "The system allowed", "We lacked guardrails"
  - Questions: "Why was this possible?" not "Who did this?"
* Retrospective facilitation
  - Separate facilitator: not the incident commander
  - All voices heard: junior engineers speak first
  - Document dissent: capture minority opinions
  - Timeline reconstruction: collaborative, non-judgmental

### G.2 Reproducibility and Testing

#### G.2.1 Controlled Reproduction
* Safe reproduction environment
  - Isolated cluster: no customer impact
  - Production-like: same config, scale, data
  - Automated: scripted reproduction steps
* Example reproduction script
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  # Reproduce Outage 2024-07-15: Thundering Herd on Leader Failover

  # Setup cluster (3 nodes)
  deploy_cluster --nodes=3 --version=v2.5.1

  # Load test data (1TB)
  load_data --size=1TB --distribution=zipfian

  # Generate background load (10K QPS)
  start_clients --qps=10000 --duration=60m &

  # Inject failure: kill leader
  sleep 300  # Let system reach steady state
  kill_node --role=leader

  # Observe: metrics spike, cascading failures
  monitor_metrics --alert-on="qps < 1000 OR latency_p99 > 1000ms"

  # Expected outcome: thundering herd causes 5-minute outage
  ```
* Verification
  - Same symptoms: metrics match original outage
  - Same root cause: confirm hypothesis
  - Fix validation: reproduction script passes after fix

#### G.2.2 Regression Testing
* Add to CI/CD
  - New test: reproduces outage, verifies fix
  - Run frequency: every commit, every deploy
  - Alert on failure: block deploy if test fails
* Test evolution
  - Parameterize: vary load, timing, configuration
  - Expand: test related failure modes
  - Maintain: update as system changes

### G.3 Case Study Summaries

#### G.3.1 Leap Second (2012-06-30)
* Incident
  - Systems affected: Hadoop, Cassandra, Linux kernel
  - Symptom: 100% CPU usage, hung processes
  - Duration: minutes to hours (varies by org)
  - Impact: Reddit down, Gawker down, StumbleUpon down
* Root cause
  - Leap second: UTC 23:59:60 inserted
  - Linux kernel hrtimer: checked time, found time went backwards
  - Infinite loop: try to advance time, fails, retry
  - Java NTP client: triggered futex storm
* Fix
  - Immediate: reboot servers (clears state)
  - Short-term: disable NTP, manual time set
  - Long-term: kernel patch, smeared leap seconds
* Lessons learned
  - Time is hard: even 1 second matters
  - Test edge cases: leap second, year 2038, DST
  - Smeared time: Google's solution (stretch over 24 hours)
* Prevention
  - Modern approach: no leap seconds (UTC without leap)
  - Kernel fixes: mainlined in Linux 3.5+
  - Cloud providers: smear automatically (AWS, GCP)

#### G.3.2 Certificate Expiration (multiple incidents)
* Common scenarios
  - Root CA expires: entire chain invalid
  - Intermediate cert expires: partial outage
  - Let's Encrypt: forgot to renew
  - Self-signed: expires after 1 year
* Examples
  - 2020-02-29: Leap day bug in Cloudflare cert validator
  - 2021-09-30: Let's Encrypt root cert expired (old Android devices)
  - 2018-06-15: Microsoft Azure cert expired (internal)
* Root causes
  - Manual renewal: human forgets
  - Automation fails: unnoticed for months
  - Hard-coded expiration: no expiration alerts
  - Testing gap: not tested in staging
* Prevention
  - Automated renewal: certbot, ACME protocol
  - Monitoring: alert 30 days before expiry
  - Testing: synthetic monitoring with real certs
  - Redundancy: multiple cert authorities, failover

#### G.3.3 AWS US-EAST-1 Outage (2017-02-28)
* Incident
  - Service: S3
  - Duration: 4 hours
  - Impact: 100K+ websites down, AWS console down
  - Financial: estimated $150M-200M economic impact
* Timeline
  - 9:37 AM: Engineer runs command to remove servers
  - Typo: removes more servers than intended
  - Subsystem 1: index subsystem loses quorum
  - Subsystem 2: placement subsystem stops accepting requests
  - Restart: takes 4 hours (cold start of massive scale)
* Root causes
  - Human error: typo in command
  - Insufficient validation: command allowed dangerous operation
  - Large blast radius: too many servers removed
  - Long recovery: system not designed for full restart
* AWS response
  - Immediate: manual recovery, add capacity
  - Short-term: modified command-line tools (require confirmation)
  - Long-term: partition index system (smaller blast radius)
* Lessons learned
  - Blast radius: limit scope of any single action
  - Confirmation: require explicit approval for dangerous ops
  - Cold start: test full system restart regularly
  - Dogfooding: AWS console depends on S3 (irony)

#### G.3.4 GitLab Database Deletion (2017-01-31)
* Incident
  - Event: production database accidentally deleted
  - Data loss: 6 hours of production data
  - Recovery time: 18 hours
  - Backups failed: 5 backup mechanisms all failed
* Timeline
  - Load spike: database replication delayed
  - Attempt to fix: engineer SSHs to wrong server
  - Command: rm -rf /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data
  - Realization: wrong server, production data deleted
  - Backup attempt 1: PostgreSQL replication broken
  - Backup attempt 2: LVM snapshots corrupted
  - Backup attempt 3: Azure disk snapshots not configured
  - Backup attempt 4: S3 backups not running
  - Backup attempt 5: Google Cloud snapshots incomplete
  - Success: found 6-hour-old snapshot on staging
* Root causes
  - Human error: wrong server
  - No confirmation: rm -rf allowed without check
  - Backup failures: never tested recovery
  - Multiple single points of failure
* GitLab's response
  - Radical transparency: live-streamed recovery
  - Postmortem: detailed, blameless, public
  - Prevention: backup testing, DB migration strategy
  - Process: change management, production access limited
* Lessons learned
  - Test backups: restore regularly, automate testing
  - Defense in depth: multiple backup mechanisms, test all
  - Access control: require confirmation for destructive ops
  - Transparency: builds trust, community support

#### G.3.5 GitHub Incident (2018-10-21)
* Incident
  - Service: GitHub.com
  - Duration: 24 hours (degraded), 1 week (full recovery)
  - Impact: stale data, split brain, data inconsistency
* Timeline
  - Network partition: US East ↔ US West for 43 seconds
  - Split brain: both sides elected new leader
  - Writes diverged: conflicting data on both sides
  - Detection: monitoring alerted, manual investigation
  - Decision: stop writes, enter read-only mode
  - Recovery: export data, reconcile conflicts, reimport
* Root causes
  - Network partition: transient fault
  - Orchestration bug: failed to prevent split brain
  - Consistency model: eventual consistency allowed divergence
  - Manual reconciliation: required human judgment
* GitHub's response
  - Immediate: read-only mode, prevent further divergence
  - Short-term: reconcile data (1 week of manual work)
  - Long-term: rewrite orchestration, stronger consistency
* Technical details
  - Orchestrator: consul, Raft-based
  - Bug: network partition caused dual leadership
  - MySQL: multi-master replication (not recommended)
* Lessons learned
  - Strong consistency: eventual consistency dangerous for primary data
  - Test partitions: chaos engineering for network faults
  - Automated recovery: manual reconciliation doesn't scale
  - Monitoring: split-brain detection, not just availability

#### G.3.6 Negative Case Study: MongoDB JIRA-10001
* Context
  - Feature: single-server durability
  - Promise: data safe on power loss
  - Reality: data loss possible until 2020
* Issue
  - Write concern: default was unacknowledged
  - Fsync: not called by default
  - Journal: disabled by default in early versions
  - Result: power loss = data loss
* Community impact
  - Criticism: "MongoDB loses data"
  - Defense: "configure it correctly"
  - Debate: defaults matter for safety
* Resolution (over 10 years)
  - 2.0: Journaling enabled by default
  - 3.2: Write concern "majority" available
  - 4.0: Retryable writes by default
  - 4.2: Distributed transactions
* Lessons learned
  - Defaults matter: users don't read docs
  - Safety first: durability on by default, even if slower
  - Marketing vs reality: be honest about limitations
  - Evolution: took years to make MongoDB truly durable
* Distributed systems principle
  - Correctness over performance: wrong answers fast is worse than slow correct answers
  - Test under failures: power loss, crashes, partitions
  - Documentation: clearly state guarantees and limitations

  - Site Reliability Engineering (Google): postmortem chapter
  - Postmortems.app: curated collection
  - GitHub outage repository: community-contributed
  - K8s postmortems: CNCF repository
