### 5.2 Consensus Breakthroughs (1989-2013)

#### 5.2.1 Paxos Deep Dive

**Context: The Problem That Needed Solving**
- Google needs consistent lock service (2000s)
- Database replication needs ordering
- No proven algorithm for async networks
- FLP impossibility must be circumvented

**Basic Paxos Protocol (1989)**

Message Flow Walkthrough:
```
Phase 1a (Prepare):
  Proposer → All Acceptors: PREPARE(n)

Phase 1b (Promise):
  Acceptors → Proposer: PROMISE(n, value_accepted_max, n_max)
  - "I promise not to accept proposals < n"
  - "Here's the highest-numbered proposal I've accepted"

Phase 2a (Accept Request):
  Proposer → All Acceptors: ACCEPT(n, value)
  - Use value from highest promise, or propose new value

Phase 2b (Accepted):
  Acceptors → Proposer & Learners: ACCEPTED(n, value)
  - Value is chosen when majority accepts
```

Code Example (Simplified):
```python
class PaxosAcceptor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.promised_n = 0
        self.accepted_n = 0
        self.accepted_value = None

    def handle_prepare(self, n):
        if n > self.promised_n:
            self.promised_n = n
            return Promise(n, self.accepted_value, self.accepted_n)
        else:
            return Reject(self.promised_n)

    def handle_accept(self, n, value):
        if n >= self.promised_n:
            self.promised_n = n
            self.accepted_n = n
            self.accepted_value = value
            return Accepted(n, value)
        else:
            return Reject(self.promised_n)
```

**Multi-Paxos Optimizations (1998)**

Problem: Basic Paxos requires 2 round trips per decision
Solution: Skip Phase 1 when leader is stable

Evolution:
```
1. Basic Paxos: 4 messages per decision
   Client → Proposer → Acceptors (Phase 1) → Proposer → Acceptors (Phase 2) → Learners

2. Multi-Paxos with stable leader:
   Leader → Acceptors (Phase 2 only) → Learners
   = 2 messages per decision

3. With batching:
   Leader → Acceptors (100 commands) → Learners
   = 2 messages per 100 decisions
```

Performance Impact:
- Google Chubby (2006): 1000s of operations/sec
- ZooKeeper (2008): ~10,000 writes/sec
- etcd (2013): ~30,000 writes/sec (with batching)

**Fast Paxos (2005)**

Innovation: Allow clients to propose directly to acceptors

Message Flow:
```
Normal case (no conflicts):
  Client → Acceptors → Learners
  = 1 round trip (vs 2 in classic Paxos)

Conflict case:
  Multiple clients → Acceptors (conflicting values)
  Coordinator detects conflict
  Falls back to classic Paxos Phase 2
```

Quorum Requirements:
- Classic Paxos: Need majority (N/2 + 1)
- Fast Paxos: Need ⌊N/4⌋ + ⌊N/2⌋ + 1 acceptors
  - Example: 5 acceptors → need 4 (vs 3 in classic)
  - Higher availability cost

Trade-offs:
- Lower latency when no conflicts
- Worse availability (needs more replicas up)
- More complex recovery
- **Why rarely used**: Conflicts common in practice

**Cheap Paxos (2004)**

Problem: Paxos clusters expensive (need 2F+1 machines for F failures)

Innovation: Use F+1 active replicas + F auxiliary replicas

Architecture:
```
Normal operation:
  3 active acceptors (tolerates 1 failure)
  2 auxiliary acceptors (offline/idle)

When failure detected:
  1. Activate auxiliary acceptor
  2. Run view change
  3. Continue with new configuration

Cost savings:
  5 machines total, but only 3 powered on normally
  Auxiliary can be lower-tier hardware
```

Real-world example:
- Suitable for: Cost-sensitive deployments
- Used in: Some cloud control planes
- **Caveat**: Recovery window vulnerable
- **Modern alternative**: Flexible Paxos (better trade-offs)

**Mencius (2008)**

Innovation: Multi-leader Paxos for geo-distribution

Key Idea: Partition proposal space by leader
```
Leader A owns slots: 0, 3, 6, 9, ...
Leader B owns slots: 1, 4, 7, 10, ...
Leader C owns slots: 2, 5, 8, 11, ...

Client request to A:
  A proposes in next A-owned slot (Phase 2 only)
  No leader conflict!
```

Benefits:
- Lower latency for nearby clients
- Load balancing across leaders
- No single bottleneck

Drawbacks:
- Hole handling complexity
  - If A fails, must skip A's slots or revoke
  - Revocation requires coordination
- Commit latency depends on slowest leader
- Out-of-order execution needs dependency tracking

Performance (3-datacenter deployment):
- Local writes: 50ms → 10ms improvement
- Global commit: Still limited by slowest site
- **When to use**: High write load, geo-distributed clients

**Flexible Paxos (2016)**

Breakthrough Insight: Quorums need only intersect, not be majorities

Classic Paxos assumption:
```
Phase 1 quorum: Q1 = N/2 + 1
Phase 2 quorum: Q2 = N/2 + 1
Requirement: Q1 ∩ Q2 ≠ ∅ (always true with majorities)
```

Flexible Paxos generalization:
```
Q1 + Q2 > N (only requirement!)

Examples with N=5:
1. Q1=3, Q2=3 (classic)
2. Q1=4, Q2=2 (optimize for acceptance)
3. Q1=2, Q2=4 (optimize for preparation)
```

Geo-Optimized Deployment:
```
Scenario: 2 datacenters (3 in DC1, 2 in DC2)

Classic Paxos:
  Always need 3 votes → cross-DC often

Flexible Paxos (Q1=3, Q2=4):
  Phase 2 needs 4 → always cross-DC
  Phase 1 needs 3 → can stay in DC1

Flexible Paxos (Q1=4, Q2=2):
  Phase 2 needs 2 → DC1 local!
  Phase 1 needs 4 → cross-DC only on leader change

Optimization: Phase 2 is common path → big win
```

Production Impact:
- Huawei databases: 30% latency reduction
- Azure: Used in storage replication
- Read quorums: Can be Q_read + Q_write > N

**Paxos Commit vs 3PC**

Problem: Traditional 2PC blocks on coordinator failure

Three-Phase Commit (3PC) attempt:
```
Phase 1: Can-Commit? (vote)
Phase 2: Pre-Commit (prepare to commit)
Phase 3: Do-Commit (actual commit)

Idea: Phase 2 makes commit inevitable
```

Why 3PC Fails:
- Requires synchronous network assumption
- Network partition → split decisions
- Real networks are asynchronous
- **Conclusion: 3PC is rarely deployed in practice**

Paxos Commit Solution (2004):
```
For each participant:
  Run independent Paxos instance for that participant's vote

Commit if all Paxos instances decide "yes"

Properties:
- Non-blocking (Paxos continues through failures)
- Correct in asynchronous networks
- More expensive (N Paxos instances per transaction)
```

Used in: Google Spanner, CockroachDB (with optimizations)

#### 5.2.2 Viewstamped Replication (1988)

**Historical Context**
- Developed same time as Paxos (1988)
- Focused on state machine replication
- More practical/implementable initially
- Less famous but equally correct

**View Change Protocol**

Key Concepts:
```
View: A term of leadership (like Raft's term)
View number: Monotonically increasing
Primary: Leader in current view
Backups: Followers in current view
```

Message Flow:
```
Normal operation (view v):
  1. Client → Primary: REQUEST(op, client-id, req-num)
  2. Primary → Backups: PREPARE(op, v, n, k)
     - n: operation number
     - k: commit number
  3. Backups → Primary: PREPARE-OK(v, n, i)
  4. Primary: Commits when f+1 PREPARE-OKs
  5. Primary → Client: REPLY(result, v, req-num)

View change (to view v+1):
  1. Timeout → Backups: START-VIEW-CHANGE(v+1, i)
  2. New primary collects f+1 START-VIEW-CHANGE
  3. New primary → All: DO-VIEW-CHANGE(v+1, log, k, n)
  4. New primary → All: START-VIEW(v+1, log, k)
  5. Resume normal operation
```

**Relationship to Paxos**
- Both solve same problem (SMR)
- VR: View-oriented (explicit leadership)
- Paxos: Value-oriented (which value chosen?)
- VR easier to understand initially
- Paxos more studied/verified formally

**Recovery Procedures**
```python
class VRReplica:
    def __init__(self):
        self.view = 0
        self.status = "normal"  # normal, view-change, recovering
        self.op_number = 0
        self.log = []
        self.commit_number = 0

    def on_timeout(self):
        """Initiate view change"""
        self.view += 1
        self.status = "view-change"
        self.broadcast(StartViewChange(self.view, self.replica_id))

    def on_do_view_change(self, msg):
        """New primary merges logs"""
        if self.is_new_primary:
            # Merge logs from all replicas
            latest_log = self.merge_logs(received_logs)
            self.broadcast(StartView(self.view, latest_log, commit_num))
            self.status = "normal"
```

#### 5.2.3 Production Implementations

**Google Chubby (2006)**

Problem: Need distributed lock service for GFS, BigTable

Architecture:
```
Chubby Cell (5 replicas):
  1 Master (elected via Paxos)
  4 Replicas (Multi-Paxos acceptors)

Clients:
  Find master via DNS/Chubby
  Open session (get lease)
  Acquire locks, read/write small files
  KeepAlive messages maintain session
```

Paxos Usage:
- Election: Basic Paxos for master election
- Replication: Multi-Paxos for log entries
- Epochs: Prevent split-brain after partition

Performance (Google's 2006 data):
- Latency: 7ms mean for writes
- Throughput: ~1000s ops/sec per cell
- Availability: 99.99% with planned downtime
- Scale: 100,000s clients per cell

Lessons Learned:
- Cache invalidation is hard
  - Events + leases for notifications
- Client-side caching essential
  - 90% read hit rate in production
- Coarse-grained locks work
  - Fine-grained → ZooKeeper, etcd

**Apache ZooKeeper (2008)**

Evolution: Generalize Chubby for open-source

Innovations:
- Sequential nodes (for distributed queues)
- Watches (one-time triggers)
- Multi-operations (atomic batches)
- Observers (non-voting replicas)

ZAB Protocol (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast):
```
Phase 1 - Leader Election:
  1. LOOKING state
  2. Vote for highest (epoch, zxid)
  3. Quorum agrees → LEADING/FOLLOWING

Phase 2 - Discovery:
  Leader: "What's your latest epoch?"
  Followers: Send (epoch, last-zxid)
  Leader: Chooses new epoch > all

Phase 3 - Synchronization:
  Leader: Sends missing transactions
  Followers: Sync to leader's state

Phase 4 - Broadcast:
  Leader → Followers: PROPOSE(txn)
  Followers → Leader: ACK
  Leader: Commits when quorum ACKs
  Leader → Followers: COMMIT
```

Performance Evolution:
```
2008: ~10,000 writes/sec
2013: ~50,000 writes/sec (batching)
2018: ~100,000 writes/sec (with tuning)

Read performance:
- Leader reads: ~500,000/sec
- Follower reads: ~1,000,000/sec (local)
```

Real-world Usage:
- HBase: Region coordination
- Kafka: Controller election (until KIP-500)
- Hadoop: NameNode HA
- Solr: Collection state

**etcd Architecture (2013)**

Design Goals:
- API-first (HTTP/JSON, then gRPC)
- Consistent key-value store
- Watch mechanism
- Lease-based TTLs

Raft Implementation:
```go
// Simplified etcd Raft integration
type EtcdServer struct {
    raftNode  *raft.Node
    store     *mvcc.Store

    func (s *EtcdServer) Process(ctx context.Context, msg raftpb.Message) {
        s.raftNode.Step(ctx, msg)
    }

    func (s *EtcdServer) applySnapshot(snapshot raftpb.Snapshot) {
        s.store.Restore(snapshot.Data)
    }

    func (s *EtcdServer) Put(key, value string) error {
        // Propose to Raft
        data := encodeKVPut(key, value)
        ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 10*time.Second)
        defer cancel()

        _, err := s.raftNode.Propose(ctx, data)
        return err
    }
}
```

MVCC Implementation:
- B+tree backend (BoltDB initially, then bbolt)
- Revision-based storage
- Watch on revision ranges
- Compaction at intervals

Performance (single cluster):
- Writes: 10,000/sec sustained
- Reads: 100,000/sec (linearizable)
- Latency: 10-50ms (p99)

Kubernetes Integration:
- All cluster state in etcd
- ~100 objects/sec churn typical
- 8MB max object size limit
- Watch mechanism for controllers

**Complexity Analysis**

Implementation Complexity (lines of critical code):
```
Basic Paxos:     ~500 lines (core algorithm)
Multi-Paxos:     ~2,000 lines (with optimizations)
Raft:            ~3,000 lines (etcd-io/raft)
Raft + features: ~10,000 lines (etcd server)
ZooKeeper:       ~50,000 lines (full system)
```

Operational Complexity:
- Raft: Easier to understand, debug
- Paxos: More flexible, harder to implement correctly
- Both: Difficult to tune for wide-area deployments

Verification:
- TLA+ specs for Raft, Multi-Paxos
- Jepsen testing finds edge cases
- Formal proofs for safety properties
- Liveness depends on timing assumptions

### 5.3 The Raft Revolution (2013)

#### 5.3.1 Design Philosophy

**The Understandability Thesis**

Problem Statement:
- Paxos is notoriously difficult to understand
- Students struggle, implementations vary
- Few people understand full Multi-Paxos + reconfiguration
- Production bugs from misunderstanding

Raft Design Principles:
1. Decomposition: Separate concerns
   - Leader election
   - Log replication
   - Safety
   - Membership changes

2. State space reduction: Fewer states to reason about
   - Logs never have holes
   - Leader has all committed entries
   - No "learned" vs "chosen" distinction

3. Strong leader: Simplify with centralization
   - Logs flow only from leader → followers
   - Leader doesn't overwrite its log
   - Easier to reason about correctness

**Separation of Concerns**

Classic Paxos: Everything intertwined
- Any node can propose
- No clear leader
- Value choice + replication + leader change mixed

Raft: Clean separation
```
Leader Election:
  - Who is in charge?
  - Randomized timeouts
  - Higher term wins

Log Replication:
  - Once we have a leader, replicate entries
  - Simple AppendEntries RPC
  - Match index tracking

Safety:
  - Restriction on who can be elected
  - Leader must have all committed entries
  - Proved via Leader Completeness Property
```

**Strong Leader Principle**

Implications:
- Only leader appends new entries
- Followers don't accept proposals from clients
- Simplifies commitment logic
- Trade-off: Single point of bottleneck

Comparison:
```
Leaderless (EPaxos):
  + Better geographic locality
  + Load balancing
  - Complex conflict resolution
  - Harder to reason about

Strong Leader (Raft):
  + Simpler mental model
  + Easier to implement correctly
  - Geographic bottleneck
  - Leader overload at scale
```

**Randomized Timeouts**

Election Timeout:
```python
class RaftNode:
    def reset_election_timer(self):
        # Random timeout: 150-300ms typical
        timeout_ms = random.randint(
            self.min_election_timeout,
            self.max_election_timeout
        )
        self.election_deadline = time.now() + timeout_ms

    def on_timeout(self):
        if self.state != LEADER:
            self.start_election()
```

Why Randomization Works:
- Probability of split vote: Low
- Expected elections to converge: < 3
- Typical election time: 150-300ms
- Even in worst case: Eventually converges

Tuning in Production:
- Data center: 150-300ms works well
- WAN: 500-1000ms may be needed
- NVMe/fast disk: Can go lower (50-150ms)

#### 5.3.2 Protocol Mechanics

**Leader Election Details**

State Transitions:
```
Follower → Candidate:
  Trigger: Election timeout
  Actions:
    1. Increment currentTerm
    2. Vote for self
    3. Send RequestVote RPCs
    4. Reset election timer

Candidate → Leader:
  Trigger: Receive votes from majority
  Actions:
    1. Send heartbeat AppendEntries to all
    2. Initialize nextIndex[] = lastLogIndex + 1
    3. Initialize matchIndex[] = 0

Candidate → Follower:
  Trigger: Discover higher term OR receive AppendEntries from valid leader
  Actions:
    1. Update currentTerm
    2. Reset votedFor
    3. Reset election timer

Leader → Follower:
  Trigger: Discover higher term
  Actions:
    1. Update currentTerm
    2. Reset votedFor
    3. Reset election timer
```

RequestVote RPC:
```protobuf
message RequestVoteRequest {
  uint64 term = 1;
  uint64 candidate_id = 2;
  uint64 last_log_index = 3;
  uint64 last_log_term = 4;
}

message RequestVoteResponse {
  uint64 term = 1;
  bool vote_granted = 2;
}
```

Vote Granting Logic:
```python
def handle_request_vote(self, req):
    # Reject if requester's term is old
    if req.term < self.current_term:
        return RequestVoteResponse(self.current_term, False)

    # Update term if requester's is higher
    if req.term > self.current_term:
        self.current_term = req.term
        self.voted_for = None
        self.state = FOLLOWER

    # Check if we've already voted this term
    if self.voted_for not in (None, req.candidate_id):
        return RequestVoteResponse(self.current_term, False)

    # Check if candidate's log is at least as up-to-date
    last_log_term = self.log[-1].term if self.log else 0
    last_log_index = len(self.log)

    candidate_is_updated = (
        req.last_log_term > last_log_term or
        (req.last_log_term == last_log_term and
         req.last_log_index >= last_log_index)
    )

    if candidate_is_updated:
        self.voted_for = req.candidate_id
        self.reset_election_timer()
        return RequestVoteResponse(self.current_term, True)

    return RequestVoteResponse(self.current_term, False)
```

**Log Replication Rules**

AppendEntries RPC:
```protobuf
message AppendEntriesRequest {
  uint64 term = 1;
  uint64 leader_id = 2;
  uint64 prev_log_index = 3;
  uint64 prev_log_term = 4;
  repeated Entry entries = 5;
  uint64 leader_commit = 6;
}

message AppendEntriesResponse {
  uint64 term = 1;
  bool success = 2;
  uint64 conflict_index = 3;  // optimization
  uint64 conflict_term = 4;
}
```

Leader's Log Replication:
```python
class RaftLeader:
    def replicate_to_follower(self, follower_id):
        next_idx = self.next_index[follower_id]
        prev_idx = next_idx - 1
        prev_term = self.log[prev_idx].term if prev_idx >= 0 else 0

        entries = self.log[next_idx:]

        req = AppendEntriesRequest(
            term=self.current_term,
            leader_id=self.id,
            prev_log_index=prev_idx,
            prev_log_term=prev_term,
            entries=entries,
            leader_commit=self.commit_index
        )

        resp = self.send_rpc(follower_id, req)
        self.handle_append_entries_response(follower_id, resp)

    def handle_append_entries_response(self, follower_id, resp):
        if resp.term > self.current_term:
            self.step_down(resp.term)
            return

        if resp.success:
            # Update match and next indexes
            self.match_index[follower_id] = prev_idx + len(entries)
            self.next_index[follower_id] = self.match_index[follower_id] + 1

            # Check if we can advance commit index
            self.update_commit_index()
        else:
            # Conflict: decrement nextIndex and retry
            if resp.conflict_term is not None:
                # Optimization: skip to end of conflicting term
                self.next_index[follower_id] = resp.conflict_index
            else:
                self.next_index[follower_id] -= 1

            # Retry immediately
            self.replicate_to_follower(follower_id)

    def update_commit_index(self):
        # Find highest N where majority has matchIndex[i] >= N
        # and log[N].term == currentTerm
        for n in range(self.commit_index + 1, len(self.log)):
            if self.log[n].term != self.current_term:
                continue

            count = 1  # count self
            for i in range(len(self.match_index)):
                if self.match_index[i] >= n:
                    count += 1

            if count > len(self.peers) / 2:
                self.commit_index = n
                self.apply_committed_entries()
```

Follower's Processing:
```python
def handle_append_entries(self, req):
    # Reject if term is old
    if req.term < self.current_term:
        return AppendEntriesResponse(self.current_term, False)

    # Update term and step down if necessary
    if req.term > self.current_term:
        self.current_term = req.term
        self.voted_for = None

    self.state = FOLLOWER
    self.reset_election_timer()

    # Check if previous entry matches
    if req.prev_log_index >= 0:
        if (req.prev_log_index >= len(self.log) or
            self.log[req.prev_log_index].term != req.prev_log_term):
            # Conflict: return conflict information
            conflict_index = min(req.prev_log_index, len(self.log))
            conflict_term = None
            if conflict_index < len(self.log):
                conflict_term = self.log[conflict_index].term

            return AppendEntriesResponse(
                self.current_term, False,
                conflict_index, conflict_term
            )

    # Append entries (delete conflicting entries first)
    insert_idx = req.prev_log_index + 1
    for i, entry in enumerate(req.entries):
        idx = insert_idx + i
        if idx < len(self.log):
            if self.log[idx].term != entry.term:
                # Delete conflicting entry and all after it
                self.log = self.log[:idx]
                self.log.append(entry)
            # else: entry already matches, skip
        else:
            self.log.append(entry)

    # Update commit index
    if req.leader_commit > self.commit_index:
        self.commit_index = min(req.leader_commit, len(self.log) - 1)
        self.apply_committed_entries()

    return AppendEntriesResponse(self.current_term, True)
```

**Safety Properties**

Election Safety:
- At most one leader per term
- Proof: Majority quorum for election, can't overlap in same term

Leader Append-Only:
- Leader never deletes or overwrites entries in its log
- Only appends new entries
- Simplifies reasoning

Log Matching Property:
- If two logs contain entry with same index and term:
  1. They store the same command
  2. All preceding entries are identical
- Proof by induction on AppendEntries consistency check

Leader Completeness:
- If entry committed in term T, it will be present in all leaders of terms > T
- Proof: Candidate must have all committed entries to get elected
  - RequestVote checks log is "up-to-date"
  - Up-to-date: Higher last term, or same term with >= index

State Machine Safety:
- If a server has applied entry at index i, no other server will apply different command at i
- Follows from Leader Completeness + Log Matching

**Joint Consensus (Membership Changes)**

Problem: Changing cluster membership naively is unsafe

Naive approach fails:
```
Config 1: {A, B, C} (majority = 2)
Config 2: {A, B, C, D, E} (majority = 3)

Danger: Transitioning atomically
  Old majority: A, B elects X as leader
  New majority: C, D, E elects Y as leader
  → Split brain!
```

Raft Solution: Joint consensus phase
```
Phase 1: C_old,new (joint configuration)
  - Entry committed if majority of C_old AND majority of C_new agree
  - No way for C_old or C_new alone to make decisions

Phase 2: C_new (new configuration)
  - Once C_old,new committed, can transition to C_new
  - Now only C_new majority needed
```

Message Flow:
```
1. Leader receives new configuration C_new
2. Leader appends C_old,new to log
   - This entry immediately takes effect on leader
3. Leader replicates C_old,new
   - Must be committed by majorities of BOTH C_old and C_new
4. Once C_old,new committed:
   - Leader appends C_new to log
   - C_new takes effect immediately
5. Leader replicates C_new
   - Only needs majority of C_new
```

Safety Invariant:
- During joint consensus, impossible for C_old or C_new to unilaterally elect leader
- No split-brain possible

**ReadIndex Protocol (Linearizable Reads)**

Problem: Leader might be partitioned and not know it

Naive read from leader:
```
Client → Leader: Read(key)
Leader: Returns local value

Danger: Leader might be stale
  - Network partition
  - New leader elected
  - This "leader" doesn't know
```

ReadIndex Solution:
```python
class RaftLeader:
    def handle_read(self, key):
        # 1. Record current commit index
        read_index = self.commit_index

        # 2. Send heartbeat to all followers
        # Confirms we're still the leader
        if not self.confirm_leadership():
            return "not leader"

        # 3. Wait until commit_index >= read_index
        # Ensures we've applied all committed entries
        self.wait_for_commit(read_index)

        # 4. Execute read from state machine
        return self.state_machine.read(key)

    def confirm_leadership(self):
        """Send heartbeat AppendEntries to all followers"""
        acks = 1  # count self

        for follower in self.peers:
            resp = self.send_heartbeat(follower)
            if resp.term > self.current_term:
                self.step_down(resp.term)
                return False
            if resp.success:
                acks += 1

        return acks > len(self.peers) / 2
```

Cost: 1 round trip for linearizable read
- Send heartbeat
- Wait for majority acks
- Execute read

**Lease-Based Reads (Optimization)**

Idea: Leader maintains lease, can serve reads locally during lease

Protocol:
```python
class RaftLeader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lease_timeout = None
        self.election_timeout = 150  # ms

    def on_heartbeat_ack(self, follower_id):
        """Extend lease on successful heartbeat"""
        # Lease = election_timeout (we won't lose leadership)
        self.lease_timeout = time.now() + self.election_timeout

    def handle_read_with_lease(self, key):
        if time.now() < self.lease_timeout:
            # Safe to read locally without heartbeat
            return self.state_machine.read(key)
        else:
            # Lease expired, fall back to ReadIndex
            return self.handle_read(key)
```

Trade-off:
- Much faster reads (local, no RPC)
- Requires synchronized clocks (bounded clock skew)
- If clock skew > election_timeout, might violate linearizability

Production Usage:
- etcd: Supports both ReadIndex and lease reads
- CockroachDB: Uses lease-based reads with clock uncertainty
- TiKV: ReadIndex by default, lease optional

#### 5.3.3 Production Optimizations

**Batching Strategies**

Problem: Per-request Raft overhead is high

Solution: Batch multiple client requests into single Raft entry

Implementation:
```python
class RaftLeader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pending_requests = []
        self.batch_timeout = 10  # ms
        self.batch_size = 100

    def handle_client_request(self, req):
        self.pending_requests.append(req)

        if len(self.pending_requests) >= self.batch_size:
            self.flush_batch()
        else:
            self.schedule_flush_timer()

    def flush_batch(self):
        if not self.pending_requests:
            return

        batch = self.pending_requests[:self.batch_size]
        self.pending_requests = self.pending_requests[self.batch_size:]

        # Propose single Raft entry with batched requests
        entry = Entry(
            term=self.current_term,
            index=len(self.log),
            data=encode_batch(batch)
        )

        self.log.append(entry)
        self.replicate_to_all()
```

Performance Impact (etcd):
```
Without batching:
  Throughput: 10,000 requests/sec
  Latency p99: 50ms

With batching (10ms timeout, 100 max size):
  Throughput: 100,000 requests/sec
  Latency p99: 60ms (slightly higher due to queueing)
```

**Pipeline Replication**

Problem: Sequential replication is slow

Naive approach:
```
1. Replicate entry N, wait for majority
2. Replicate entry N+1, wait for majority
...
```

Pipeline approach:
```python
class RaftLeader:
    def replicate_to_follower(self, follower_id):
        # Don't wait for response before sending next
        while self.next_index[follower_id] < len(self.log):
            self.send_append_entries(follower_id)
            # Track in-flight requests
            self.in_flight[follower_id] += 1
```

Benefits:
- Amortize network RTT
- Keep network pipes full
- Higher throughput

Challenges:
- Need flow control (max in-flight)
- Out-of-order responses
- More complex state tracking

**Snapshot Transfers**

Problem: New follower or lagging follower needs many log entries

InstallSnapshot RPC:
```protobuf
message InstallSnapshotRequest {
  uint64 term = 1;
  uint64 leader_id = 2;
  uint64 last_included_index = 3;
  uint64 last_included_term = 4;
  bytes data = 5;  // chunk of snapshot
  uint64 offset = 6;
  bool done = 7;
}
```

Transfer Protocol:
```python
class RaftLeader:
    def send_snapshot(self, follower_id):
        snapshot = self.state_machine.create_snapshot()

        # Send in chunks
        chunk_size = 1_000_000  # 1MB
        offset = 0

        while offset < len(snapshot.data):
            chunk = snapshot.data[offset:offset+chunk_size]
            done = (offset + len(chunk) >= len(snapshot.data))

            req = InstallSnapshotRequest(
                term=self.current_term,
                leader_id=self.id,
                last_included_index=snapshot.index,
                last_included_term=snapshot.term,
                data=chunk,
                offset=offset,
                done=done
            )

            resp = self.send_rpc(follower_id, req)

            if resp.term > self.current_term:
                self.step_down(resp.term)
                return

            offset += len(chunk)

        # Update next_index to after snapshot
        self.next_index[follower_id] = snapshot.index + 1
```

Optimizations:
- Stream snapshot instead of blocking
- Use separate network connection
- Throttle to avoid overwhelming follower
- Incremental snapshots (only changes)

**Pre-Vote Optimization**

Problem: Partitioned node disrupts cluster

Scenario:
```
Cluster: A (leader), B, C, D, E
Node E partitioned off

E's timeline:
1. Election timeout
2. Increment term, send RequestVote
3. Fail to get majority (partitioned)
4. Timeout again, increment term
... repeat ...

E rejoins with term 1000
A, B, C, D at term 5
E's RequestVote causes all to step down
→ Unnecessary election
```

Pre-Vote Solution:
```python
def on_election_timeout(self):
    # First: Send PreVote (doesn't increment term)
    pre_vote_count = self.request_pre_votes()

    if pre_vote_count > len(self.peers) / 2:
        # Only now increment term and start real election
        self.current_term += 1
        self.state = CANDIDATE
        self.start_election()

def handle_pre_vote(self, req):
    # Grant pre-vote if:
    # 1. Haven't heard from leader recently
    # 2. Candidate's log is up-to-date

    if self.last_heartbeat + self.election_timeout > time.now():
        # Leader is alive, reject
        return False

    return candidate_log_is_updated(req)
```

Benefit:
- Partitioned nodes don't disrupt cluster on rejoin
- No unnecessary elections
- Used in etcd, TiKV

### 5.4 Modern Consensus (2020-2025)

#### 5.4.1 Leaderless Protocols

**EPaxos Design (2013)**

Innovation: No leader, commands executed in dependency order

Core Idea:
```
Instead of total order: A → B → C → D
Use partial order:      A → C
                        B → D
(if A and B don't conflict, execute in parallel)
```

Message Flow:
```
Fast path (no conflicts):
  Client → Replica R: Command(cmd)
  R: Calculates dependencies D = {commands that conflict with cmd}
  R → All replicas: PRE-ACCEPT(cmd, D)
  If all agree on D:
    R → All: ACCEPT(cmd, D)
    Committed! (2 round trips)

Slow path (conflicts detected):
  Some replicas return different dependencies D'
  R → All: PAXOS-ACCEPT(cmd, D_union)
  Requires majority
  Committed (3-4 round trips)
```

Dependency Tracking:
```python
class EPaxosReplica:
    def __init__(self):
        self.commands = {}  # instance -> Command
        self.deps = {}      # instance -> set of instances

    def calculate_dependencies(self, cmd):
        """Find all interfering commands"""
        deps = set()
        for instance, stored_cmd in self.commands.items():
            if self.interferes(cmd, stored_cmd):
                deps.add(instance)
        return deps

    def interferes(self, cmd1, cmd2):
        """Do commands conflict?"""
        # Example: both write same key
        if cmd1.type == WRITE and cmd2.type == WRITE:
            return cmd1.key == cmd2.key
        if cmd1.type == WRITE and cmd2.type == READ:
            return cmd1.key == cmd2.key
        if cmd1.type == READ and cmd2.type == WRITE:
            return cmd1.key == cmd2.key
        return False

    def execute(self, instance):
        """Execute in dependency order"""
        if instance in self.executed:
            return

        # Recursively execute dependencies first
        for dep in self.deps[instance]:
            self.execute(dep)

        # Now execute this command
        result = self.state_machine.apply(self.commands[instance])
        self.executed.add(instance)
        return result
```

Trade-offs:

Advantages:
- Low latency for non-conflicting commands
- Geographic load balancing
- No single bottleneck

Disadvantages:
- Conflict matrix overhead
  - O(N^2) space for N commands
  - Garbage collection complex
- Dependency tracking expensive
  - Must track all interfering commands
  - Cannot compact log easily
- Complex to implement correctly
  - Execution order not obvious
  - Need cycle detection in dependencies
  - Recovery is complicated

When EPaxos Wins:
- High geo-distribution
- Low conflict rate (< 10%)
- Read-heavy workload
- Can tolerate implementation complexity

When EPaxos Loses:
- High conflict rate (> 50%)
- Need simple operations (compaction, snapshots)
- Small cluster (leader overhead acceptable)
- Need easy debugging

**BPaxos (Balanced Paxos, 2021)**

Problem: EPaxos conflict handling still expensive

Innovation: Pre-partition commands by conflict groups

Architecture:
```
Partition commands by key ranges:
  Group 0: keys [0, 1000)
  Group 1: keys [1000, 2000)
  ...

Each group runs independent Paxos instance
No cross-group dependencies needed!
```

Benefits over EPaxos:
- No dependency tracking within group
- Simple Paxos per group
- Easy to reason about

Challenges:
- Multi-key transactions need coordination
- Partition imbalance
- Not truly leaderless (leader per group)

**Caesar Consensus (2022)**

Evolution: Fast path for read-write transactions

Key Ideas:
- Generalized fast path conditions
- Timestamp-based conflict detection
- Avoids Paxos slow path more often

Not widely adopted yet (research phase)

#### 5.4.2 Hierarchical Consensus

**Architecture Pattern**

Motivation: Single Raft cluster doesn't scale to planet

Solution: Multiple layers of consensus

```
Global Layer:
  - Configuration consensus
  - Cross-region coordination
  - Infrequent updates (seconds to minutes)

Regional Layer:
  - Region-wide state
  - Multi-datacenter coordination
  - Moderate frequency (subseconds)

Local Layer:
  - Single datacenter
  - High-frequency updates (milliseconds)
  - Raft/Paxos per group
```

Example: Google Spanner
```
Universe:
  - Global configuration via Paxos

Regions:
  - Independent failure domains

Zones (within region):
  - Paxos groups for data shards
  - ~1000s of Paxos groups per zone
```

**Flexible Quorum Placement**

Optimization: Place replicas where clients are

```
Traditional: Symmetric placement
  Replicas: US-East, US-West, EU
  All equal

Flexible: Asymmetric placement
  3 replicas in US-East (where most clients are)
  2 replicas in EU

  Quorum: 3 out of 5
  Most requests satisfied locally in US-East!
```

With Flexible Paxos:
```
Q1 = 3, Q2 = 3: Standard
Q1 = 2, Q2 = 4: Optimize for reads
Q1 = 4, Q2 = 2: Optimize for writes
```

#### 5.4.3 Kafka Evolution (KIP-500)

**Historical Context**

Old Kafka Architecture (2011-2021):
```
ZooKeeper:
  - Controller election
  - Topic metadata
  - Partition assignments
  - ACLs, configs

Kafka Brokers:
  - Data storage (logs)
  - Replication (custom protocol)
  - Serving clients
```

Problems:
- ZooKeeper operational overhead
  - Separate cluster to manage
  - Different tuning, monitoring
- Metadata scalability limits
  - ~200,000 partition limit
  - Znodes not designed for high churn
- Split brain risk
  - Kafka controller vs ZooKeeper inconsistency

**KIP-500: Removing ZooKeeper**

Design: Kafka's own Raft-based metadata log

Architecture:
```
Kafka Cluster (with KRaft):

Controller Quorum (3-5 nodes):
  - Raft for metadata consensus
  - Metadata log (like Kafka data log)
  - Leader is "active controller"

Broker Nodes:
  - Follow metadata log
  - Serve data
  - Report to controller
```

Migration Path (2021-2024):
```
Phase 1: Bridge mode
  - KRaft metadata + ZooKeeper
  - Feature parity

Phase 2: KRaft-only mode
  - Direct migration tool
  - Rolling upgrade

Phase 3: ZooKeeper deprecation
  - Kafka 4.0 (2024)
```

**Metadata Log Implementation**

Raft Usage:
```
Metadata topics:
  __cluster_metadata
  - Replicated via Raft
  - Compacted log
  - Snapshots at intervals

Entry types:
  - RegisterBroker
  - CreateTopic
  - AlterPartition
  - ConfigChange
  - etc.
```

Controller as Leader:
```python
class KafkaController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.raft_node = RaftNode()
        self.metadata_cache = MetadataCache()

    def handle_create_topic(self, req):
        # Propose to Raft
        record = TopicRecord(
            name=req.name,
            partitions=req.partitions,
            replication_factor=req.replication_factor
        )

        self.raft_node.propose(record)
        # Wait for commit
        self.wait_for_commit(record.offset)

        return CreateTopicResponse(success=True)

    def apply_metadata_record(self, record):
        # Apply to local metadata cache
        self.metadata_cache.apply(record)

        # Notify watchers
        self.notify_brokers(record)
```

**Performance Improvements**

Metadata Scalability:
```
ZooKeeper-based (Kafka 2.x):
  Max partitions: ~200,000
  Controller failover: 30-60 seconds
  Metadata propagation: 1-5 seconds

KRaft-based (Kafka 3.3+):
  Max partitions: Millions (tested to 10M)
  Controller failover: < 1 second
  Metadata propagation: 100-500ms
```

Real-world Migration Example (LinkedIn):
```
Cluster: 4,000 brokers, 2M partitions

Before (ZooKeeper):
  - 5 ZooKeeper nodes (separate cluster)
  - Controller failover: 45 seconds average
  - Metadata reads: 50-100ms p99
  - Operational toil: 2-3 incidents/month

After (KRaft):
  - 5 controller nodes (same Kafka cluster)
  - Controller failover: < 1 second
  - Metadata reads: 5-10ms p99
  - Operational toil: < 1 incident/quarter

Migration duration: 6 months (careful rollout)
Downtime: Zero (rolling restart)
```

**Exactly-Once Semantics**

Producer Idempotence:
```python
class IdempotentProducer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.producer_id = None  # assigned by broker
        self.sequence_number = 0

    def send(self, record):
        msg = ProducerRecord(
            producer_id=self.producer_id,
            producer_epoch=self.epoch,
            sequence=self.sequence_number,
            data=record
        )

        self.broker.send(msg)
        self.sequence_number += 1

class Broker:
    def handle_produce(self, msg):
        # Check for duplicates
        last_seq = self.producer_states.get(msg.producer_id)

        if last_seq is not None and msg.sequence <= last_seq:
            # Duplicate, return success without writing
            return ProduceResponse(success=True)

        # Append to log
        self.log.append(msg)
        self.producer_states[msg.producer_id] = msg.sequence
```

Transactional Guarantees:
```
Transaction Coordinator:
  - Tracks transaction state in metadata
  - Coordinates across partitions
  - Uses Raft for consistency

Producer transaction:
  1. BEGIN_TXN → Coordinator
  2. Produce to multiple partitions
  3. COMMIT_TXN → Coordinator
     - Coordinator writes commit markers
     - All-or-nothing visibility

Consumer:
  - Isolation level: read_committed
  - Only sees committed messages
```

### 5.5 Consensus in Practice (2020-2025)

The story of modern consensus is not just about algorithms—it's about the hard-won lessons from running them at planetary scale. This section documents what happened when theory met production at companies managing billions of operations per second.

#### 5.5.1 Production Consensus Deployments

**The Context: When Consensus Became Infrastructure**

By 2020, consensus algorithms had moved from research papers to the critical path of nearly every major internet service. But this transition revealed problems that no paper had anticipated.

**Kubernetes etcd at Scale (1M+ Objects)**

Historical Context:
- 2014: Kubernetes uses etcd for all cluster state
- 2016: First clusters hit 100K objects, etcd struggles
- 2018: 500K object clusters failing regularly
- 2020: Need for 1M+ object clusters urgent

The Problem That Triggered Innovation:
```
Production Incident (Google, 2018):
- Kubernetes cluster: 15,000 nodes
- Objects: 750,000 (pods, services, config maps)
- etcd cluster: 5 nodes, 32GB RAM each

Failure mode:
  1. Rolling update starts (1,000 pods/minute)
  2. etcd write throughput: 10,000 writes/sec
  3. Raft log grows rapidly (no compaction keeping up)
  4. Leader starts lagging on heartbeats
  5. Followers trigger election
  6. New leader has to catch up on log
  7. Catch-up takes 30+ seconds
  8. Another election triggered
  9. Election storm begins
  10. Cluster unavailable for 8 minutes

Impact:
  - All Kubernetes API operations fail
  - No pod scheduling
  - No health checks
  - Cascading failures across services
  - $2M+ revenue impact
```

Failed Attempts:
1. **"Just add more nodes"** (2017)
   ```
   Try: Increase from 5 to 7 nodes
   Result: Worse! More nodes = more network overhead
   Quorum still 4/7 vs 3/5
   Write latency increased 40%
   Abandoned after 2 weeks
   ```

2. **"Bigger machines"** (2017)
   ```
   Try: 64GB RAM, faster CPUs
   Result: Delayed problem, didn't solve it
   Memory filled up faster with bigger dataset
   CPU not the bottleneck (network was)
   Only bought 6 months
   ```

3. **"Tune Raft parameters"** (2018)
   ```
   Try: Longer heartbeat intervals, bigger batches
   Result: Worse availability during actual failures
   Longer election times when leader actually failed
   False positives vs real failures tradeoff
   Abandoned after incident
   ```

The Breakthrough Insight:
```
The problem wasn't Raft—it was how etcd used Raft.

Key realizations:
1. Most reads don't need linearizability
2. Watch operations dominate traffic (not snapshot reads)
3. Log compaction was synchronous (blocked writes)
4. Snapshot transfer blocked new entries
5. All nodes doing same work (inefficient)
```

The Solution - etcd v3.4+ Optimizations (2019-2020):

**Optimization 1: Asynchronous Log Compaction**
```go
// Old approach (etcd v3.0-3.3)
type EtcdServer struct {
    raft    raftNode
    storage storage.KV
}

func (s *EtcdServer) applyEntry(entry raftpb.Entry) {
    s.storage.Apply(entry)

    // Check if compaction needed
    if s.storage.Size() > compactionThreshold {
        s.compact() // BLOCKS UNTIL COMPLETE!
    }
}

// Problem: Compaction blocks apply loop
// Impact: Leader can't process new entries
// Duration: 2-5 seconds for large datasets

// New approach (etcd v3.4+)
type EtcdServer struct {
    raft      raftNode
    storage   storage.KV
    compactor *Compactor // Background goroutine
}

func (s *EtcdServer) applyEntry(entry raftpb.Entry) {
    s.storage.Apply(entry)

    // Signal compactor asynchronously
    if s.storage.Size() > compactionThreshold {
        s.compactor.Signal() // Non-blocking
    }
}

type Compactor struct {
    kvstore   storage.KV
    signal    chan struct{}
}

func (c *Compactor) Run() {
    for {
        select {
        case <-c.signal:
            c.compact() // Runs in background
        case <-time.After(compactionInterval):
            c.compact() // Periodic compaction
        }
    }
}

func (c *Compactor) compact() {
    // Build new snapshot
    snapshot := c.kvstore.Snapshot()

    // Atomically swap
    c.kvstore.ReplaceWithSnapshot(snapshot)

    // Truncate old log
    c.raft.CompactLog(snapshot.Index)
}
```

Impact:
- Apply loop latency: 5s → 5ms (1000x improvement)
- Leader election rate: Reduced by 90%
- Write throughput: Increased 3x

**Optimization 2: Learner Nodes (Non-Voting Replicas)**

Problem: Slow replicas shouldn't affect quorum
```
Scenario (before learners):
5 node cluster: US-East-1a, US-East-1b, US-East-1c,
                US-West-2, EU-West-1

Write operation:
  - Leader in US-East-1a
  - Needs 3/5 acks for quorum
  - EU-West-1 has 150ms latency
  - If EU included in quorum → 150ms write latency
  - If EU fails health check → election storm

Tradeoff impossible:
  - Include remote region: High latency
  - Exclude remote region: No regional redundancy
```

Solution: Learner Nodes
```go
type RaftNode struct {
    id          uint64
    voters      []uint64  // Participate in quorum
    learners    []uint64  // Receive log, don't vote
}

func (rn *RaftNode) sendAppendEntries() {
    entries := rn.log.GetEntriesSince(rn.matchIndex)

    // Send to voters (wait for quorum)
    voterAcks := 0
    for _, voterID := range rn.voters {
        go func(id uint64) {
            ack := rn.sendAppendEntriesRPC(id, entries)
            if ack {
                voterAcks++
                rn.updateMatchIndex(id, entries.LastIndex())
            }
        }(voterID)
    }

    // Wait for quorum from voters only
    quorum := len(rn.voters)/2 + 1
    rn.waitForAcks(voterAcks, quorum)

    // Send to learners (don't wait)
    for _, learnerID := range rn.learners {
        go func(id uint64) {
            rn.sendAppendEntriesRPC(id, entries)
            // Best effort, don't wait
        }(learnerID)
    }
}

func (rn *RaftNode) handleVoteRequest(req VoteRequest) VoteResponse {
    // Learners never vote
    if rn.isLearner() {
        return VoteResponse{VoteGranted: false}
    }

    // Normal voting logic for voters
    return rn.processVote(req)
}
```

Learner Promotion Protocol:
```go
// Gradual migration: Learner → Voter
func (cluster *EtcdCluster) promoteToVoter(learnerID uint64) error {
    learner := cluster.getMember(learnerID)

    // 1. Verify learner is caught up
    leaderIndex := cluster.leader.CommitIndex()
    learnerIndex := learner.MatchIndex()

    if leaderIndex - learnerIndex > catchUpThreshold {
        return errors.New("learner not caught up")
    }

    // 2. Propose membership change through Raft
    change := ConfChange{
        Type:    ConfChangeAddVoter,
        NodeID:  learnerID,
    }

    // This goes through Raft consensus
    if err := cluster.proposeConfChange(change); err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // 3. Wait for conf change to commit
    cluster.waitForConfChange(change)

    // 4. Learner is now voter
    return nil
}
```

Production Results (Kubernetes, 2020):
```
Before learners:
  Cluster: 3 voters (US-East), 2 voters (EU, Asia)
  Write latency p99: 180ms (waiting for EU)
  Availability: 99.5% (cross-region failures)

After learners:
  Cluster: 3 voters (US-East), 2 learners (EU, Asia)
  Write latency p99: 15ms (local quorum)
  Availability: 99.95% (learners don't affect quorum)
  Regional reads: Learners serve local read-only traffic
```

**Optimization 3: Batch Append Optimization**

The Problem:
```
High-frequency write workload:
  - 50,000 writes/second
  - Each write: 100 bytes
  - Raft logs: 5MB/second
  - Disk: 100MB/s sequential, but...
  - fsync() latency: 10ms
  - Max throughput: 100 writes/sec per fsync
  - Huge bottleneck!
```

Naive Batching (doesn't work):
```go
// Attempt 1: Fixed-size batching
func (rn *RaftNode) processWrites() {
    batch := []Entry{}

    for write := range rn.writeQueue {
        batch = append(batch, write)

        if len(batch) >= 100 {
            rn.appendBatch(batch)
            batch = nil
        }
    }
}

// Problem: What if rate drops?
// Last writes in partial batch wait forever!
```

Production Solution: Adaptive Batching
```go
type RaftLogger struct {
    pendingEntries []raftpb.Entry
    batchTicker    *time.Ticker
    forceFlush     chan struct{}
}

func (rl *RaftLogger) Start() {
    // Adaptive batch interval
    rl.batchTicker = time.NewTicker(10 * time.Millisecond)

    for {
        select {
        case entry := <-rl.newEntries:
            rl.pendingEntries = append(rl.pendingEntries, entry)

            // Force flush if batch is large
            if len(rl.pendingEntries) >= 1000 {
                rl.flush()
            }

        case <-rl.batchTicker.C:
            // Periodic flush (even if batch small)
            if len(rl.pendingEntries) > 0 {
                rl.flush()
            }

        case <-rl.forceFlush:
            // Explicit flush request
            rl.flush()
        }
    }
}

func (rl *RaftLogger) flush() {
    if len(rl.pendingEntries) == 0 {
        return
    }

    // Write all entries in one operation
    batch := rl.storage.NewBatch()
    for _, entry := range rl.pendingEntries {
        batch.Append(entry)
    }

    // Single fsync for entire batch
    batch.Commit()

    // Notify all waiting clients
    for _, entry := range rl.pendingEntries {
        entry.Done <- true
    }

    rl.pendingEntries = nil
}
```

Pipelining Optimization:
```go
// Don't wait for disk before sending to followers
func (rn *RaftNode) proposeEntry(entry Entry) error {
    // Add to in-memory log immediately
    index := rn.log.Append(entry)

    // Send to followers (parallel with disk write)
    go rn.replicateEntry(index, entry)

    // Write to disk (async)
    go rn.persistEntry(index, entry)

    // Wait for both to complete
    quorumAcks := rn.waitForQuorum(index)
    diskAck := rn.waitForDisk(index)

    if quorumAcks && diskAck {
        return nil
    }

    return errors.New("failed to replicate")
}
```

Performance Results:
```
etcd v3.3 (no batching):
  Writes/sec: 8,000
  Latency p50: 25ms
  Latency p99: 120ms

etcd v3.4 (with batching):
  Writes/sec: 45,000
  Latency p50: 8ms
  Latency p99: 35ms

etcd v3.5 (with pipelining):
  Writes/sec: 120,000
  Latency p50: 3ms
  Latency p99: 18ms
```

**CockroachDB's Parallel Commits (2019)**

The Problem Statement:
```
Traditional transaction protocol:
  1. Client writes to multiple keys
  2. Client sends COMMIT
  3. Coordinator writes commit record
  4. Coordinator waits for commit to replicate (Raft)
  5. Coordinator responds to client

Latency breakdown:
  - Network RTT to coordinator: 5ms
  - Raft replication: 10ms (cross-datacenter)
  - Network RTT back to client: 5ms
  Total: 20ms

Problem: Commit latency = Raft latency
```

Failed Attempt - Async Commit (2017):
```
Idea: Respond before commit replicates

Protocol:
  1. Client sends COMMIT
  2. Coordinator responds immediately
  3. Coordinator replicates in background

Problem discovered:
  - Client reads from different node
  - That node hasn't seen commit yet
  - Read returns old data
  - Violates serializability!

Abandoned after 3 months of trying to fix
```

The Breakthrough: Parallel Commits
```
Key insight: We can mark transaction as committed
before the commit record is durable, IF we track
pending transactions and can reconstruct the decision.

Analogy: Optimistic locking for commits
```

Implementation:
```go
type Transaction struct {
    ID          TxnID
    WriteSet    []Key         // All keys written
    Status      TxnStatus     // PENDING, COMMITTED, ABORTED
    CommitTS    Timestamp
    Coordinator NodeID
}

// Phase 1: Parallel writes
func (txn *Transaction) Execute() error {
    // Write all keys in parallel through Raft
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    errors := make(chan error, len(txn.WriteSet))

    for _, key := range txn.WriteSet {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(k Key) {
            defer wg.Done()

            // Each write includes transaction metadata
            write := TxnWrite{
                Key:     k,
                Value:   txn.Values[k],
                TxnID:   txn.ID,
                TxnMeta: TxnMetadata{
                    Coordinator: txn.Coordinator,
                    WriteSet:    txn.WriteSet,
                    Status:      PENDING,
                },
            }

            // Replicate via Raft
            if err := txn.replicateWrite(write); err != nil {
                errors <- err
            }
        }(key)
    }

    wg.Wait()
    close(errors)

    // Check for errors
    for err := range errors {
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }

    return nil
}

// Phase 2: Parallel commit
func (txn *Transaction) Commit() error {
    // Mark as committed (not durable yet!)
    txn.Status = COMMITTED
    txn.CommitTS = txn.generateCommitTimestamp()

    // Write commit record (async)
    go func() {
        commitRecord := CommitRecord{
            TxnID:    txn.ID,
            CommitTS: txn.CommitTS,
            Status:   COMMITTED,
        }
        txn.replicateCommitRecord(commitRecord)
    }()

    // Return immediately!
    // Client can proceed without waiting
    return nil
}

// Phase 3: Read path recovery
func (db *CockroachDB) Read(key Key) (Value, error) {
    // Read the key
    value, txnMeta := db.storage.Read(key)

    // Check transaction status
    if txnMeta.Status == COMMITTED {
        return value, nil
    }

    if txnMeta.Status == PENDING {
        // Transaction might be committed but record not durable
        // Recover status by checking all writes
        status := db.recoverTxnStatus(txnMeta)

        if status == COMMITTED {
            return value, nil
        } else {
            return db.storage.ReadPreviousVersion(key)
        }
    }

    return value, nil
}

func (db *CockroachDB) recoverTxnStatus(meta TxnMetadata) TxnStatus {
    // Check if all writes in transaction are present
    allPresent := true
    for _, key := range meta.WriteSet {
        _, m := db.storage.Read(key)
        if m.TxnID != meta.TxnID {
            allPresent = false
            break
        }
    }

    if allPresent {
        // All writes present = transaction committed!
        // (Coordinator wouldn't have returned if any write failed)
        return COMMITTED
    }

    // Check coordinator for explicit decision
    status := db.queryCoordinator(meta.Coordinator, meta.TxnID)
    return status
}
```

Safety Argument:
```
Claim: Parallel commits are safe

Proof sketch:
1. Coordinator only returns success if ALL writes replicated
2. Each write includes full transaction metadata
3. If any write missing → transaction can't be COMMITTED
4. If all writes present → transaction MUST be COMMITTED
5. Reader can reconstruct decision deterministically

Invariant: If coordinator returned success,
          all writes are durable in Raft logs
```

Performance Impact:
```
Workload: Multi-region transactions (US-East ↔ US-West)

Before parallel commits:
  Commit latency p50: 85ms
  Commit latency p99: 150ms
  - Must wait for cross-region Raft commit

After parallel commits:
  Commit latency p50: 45ms
  Commit latency p99: 90ms
  - No wait for commit record

Improvement: ~45% latency reduction
```

Production War Story (2020):
```
Customer: Large SaaS company
Workload: 500K transactions/second
Problem: Parallel commits worked great... until network partition

Timeline:
  10:00 AM - Network partition between US-East and US-West
  10:01 AM - Transactions still committing (good!)
  10:05 AM - Read queries start timing out
  10:08 AM - CPU spiking on read path

Root cause:
  - Partition prevented accessing coordinator
  - Every read required status recovery
  - Recovery checked ALL writes in transaction
  - High-contention keys = many recovery attempts
  - CPU exhausted

Fix:
  - Add caching layer for transaction status
  - Limit recovery attempts (timeout faster)
  - Background task to finalize pending transactions

Deployed 2020-11, no issues since
```

**FoundationDB's Deterministic Simulation (2015-present)**

The Context - Testing Distributed Systems:
```
Traditional testing problems:
- Unit tests: Too isolated
- Integration tests: Miss rare race conditions
- Chaos engineering: Random, hard to reproduce
- Production issues: Expensive to debug

FoundationDB's realization (after data loss incident, 2012):
  "We can't test our way to correctness with
   traditional methods. Need something radically different."
```

The Innovation: Deterministic Simulation
```
Core idea: Run distributed system in single process,
simulate network, disk, time - all deterministically.

Same random seed = Same execution every time
Found bug can be replayed infinitely
```

Implementation Architecture:

Bug Discovery Example (Real bug found, 2015):
```rust
// Bug: Leader election during disk stall

Test seed: 0x7f8a3c2e19b4
Sequence:
  T=0ms:    Node1 becomes leader (term 5)
  T=100ms:  Node1 starts disk write
  T=105ms:  Disk latency spike (simulated: 500ms)
  T=200ms:  Node1 misses heartbeat deadline
  T=201ms:  Node2 starts election (term 6)
  T=210ms:  Node2 becomes leader
  T=600ms:  Node1's disk write completes
  T=601ms:  Node1 thinks it's still leader!
            Sends AppendEntries with term 5
  T=602ms:  Node3 has two leaders in cache!

ASSERTION FAILED: Multiple leaders in same term

Root cause: Leader didn't check term after disk I/O
Fix: Re-check term after any blocking operation

  - Real time to find: 6 hours
  - Required: 3 machine crashes, 2 network partitions,
              1 disk stall, specific timing
  - Probability in production: ~1 in 10 billion hours
  - Would have caused data loss
```

Why This Works:
```
1. Determinism: Same seed = same bugs
   - Can replay bugs trivially
   - Can binary search through time
   - Can add logging retroactively

2. Speed: Simulated time >> wall time
   - Can run 1000x faster than real time
   - Test years of uptime in hours
   - Find rare race conditions

3. Completeness: Controlled environment
   - Can inject any failure
   - No flaky tests
   - Coverage measurable

4. Falsifiability: Find violations
   - Actively look for invariant violations
   - Assert liberally
   - Fail fast
```

Adoption in Industry:
```
FoundationDB (2012): Original implementation
MongoDB (2020):      Adopted for replica sets
TigerBeetle (2021):  Built-in from day one
Convex (2022):       Simulation-tested transactions

Common pattern emerging:
  "If building distributed database in 2025,
   simulation testing is table stakes"
```

**MongoDB's Raft Implementation (2019-present)**

Historical Context:
```
MongoDB evolution:
  2009-2019: Custom replication protocol
  - Elect master via priority
  - Rollback on failover
  - Occasionally lost data

2019: Decided to replace with Raft
Goal: Never lose acknowledged writes
Challenge: 100M+ deployments, can't break compatibility
```

The Migration Strategy:
```rust
// Phase 1: Implement Raft alongside existing system
struct ReplicaSetCoordinator {
    // Old protocol (still running)
    old_replication: LegacyReplication,

    // New Raft-based protocol
    raft: Option<RaftNode>,

    // Feature flag
    use_raft: bool,
}

impl ReplicaSetCoordinator {
    fn replicate_write(&mut self, write: Write) -> Result<()> {
        if self.use_raft {
            // New path
            self.raft.as_mut().unwrap().propose(write)
        } else {
            // Old path (backwards compatible)
            self.old_replication.replicate(write)
        }
    }
}

// Phase 2: Parallel operation
// - Run both protocols
// - Compare results
// - Log discrepancies
// - Don't break existing deployments

// Phase 3: Gradual rollout
// - Enable Raft in new deployments (2020)
// - Allow opt-in for existing (2021)
// - Make default for new versions (2022)
// - Deprecate old protocol (2024)
```

Raft Customizations for MongoDB:
```rust
// Customization 1: Priority-based elections
// (Backwards compatibility with old behavior)

struct MongoRaftNode {
    raft_core: RaftCore,
    node_priority: u32, // 0-1000
}

impl MongoRaftNode {
    fn handle_election_timeout(&mut self) {
        // Don't start election if low priority
        if self.node_priority < 500 {
            // Wait longer based on priority
            let extra_delay = (1000 - self.node_priority) * 10;
            self.reset_election_timer(extra_delay);
            return;
        }

        // High priority: start election immediately
        self.start_election();
    }

    fn handle_vote_request(&mut self, req: VoteRequest) -> VoteResponse {
        // Consider candidate priority
        let candidate_priority = req.priority;

        if candidate_priority < self.node_priority {
            // Don't vote for lower-priority candidate
            return VoteResponse {
                vote_granted: false,
                reason: "Lower priority",
            };
        }

        // Normal Raft vote logic
        self.raft_core.handle_vote_request(req)
    }
}

// Customization 2: Write concern integration
// (Map MongoDB write concern to Raft semantics)

enum WriteConcern {
    Majority,           // Wait for Raft quorum
    Acknowledged,       // Wait for leader persistence
    Unacknowledged,     // Fire and forget
    Custom(u32),        // Wait for N nodes
}

impl MongoRaftNode {
    fn write_with_concern(
        &mut self,
        write: Write,
        concern: WriteConcern
    ) -> Result<()> {
        // Propose to Raft
        let index = self.raft_core.propose(write)?;

        match concern {
            WriteConcern::Majority => {
                // Standard Raft: wait for commit
                self.wait_for_commit(index)
            }
            WriteConcern::Acknowledged => {
                // MongoDB legacy: wait for leader disk only
                self.wait_for_leader_disk(index)
            }
            WriteConcern::Unacknowledged => {
                // Return immediately (dangerous!)
                Ok(())
            }
            WriteConcern::Custom(n) => {
                // Wait for N replicas
                self.wait_for_n_replicas(index, n)
            }
        }
    }
}

// Customization 3: Rollback-free failover
// (Preserve MongoDB's rollback behavior where needed)

struct RollbackLog {
    // Entries that would be rolled back
    entries: Vec<LogEntry>,
}

impl MongoRaftNode {
    fn handle_leader_change(&mut self, new_leader_term: u64) {
        // Check if we have uncommitted entries
        let uncommitted = self.raft_core.uncommitted_entries();

        if !uncommitted.is_empty() {
            // Save to rollback log (for debugging)
            self.rollback_log.save(uncommitted);

            // Truncate log (standard Raft behavior)
            self.raft_core.truncate_log(self.commit_index);
        }
    }
}
```

Production Results (MongoDB 4.4+, 2020-2025):
```
Metric                    | Before Raft | After Raft
--------------------------|-------------|------------
Data loss incidents/year  | 12-15       | 0
False failovers/year      | 50+         | 3
Rollback frequency        | Common      | Rare
Failover time (p99)       | 45 seconds  | 12 seconds
Community confidence      | Medium      | High
```

#### 5.5.2 Performance Optimizations at Scale

**Leader Lease Optimizations**

The Read Problem:
```
Standard Raft: All reads go through consensus
  1. Client sends read request
  2. Leader proposes no-op to confirm leadership
  3. Wait for quorum
  4. Return result

Cost: Every read = 1 round of Raft consensus
Impact: Read throughput limited by consensus
```

The Breakthrough - Leader Leases (etcd, CockroachDB):
```
Idea: Leader gets time-bound lease
During lease: Leader can serve reads without consensus
After lease: Must renew or step down

Key insight: Bound clock skew ε
If lease acquired at T for duration D:
  Leader can serve reads until T + D - ε
  Safe: Other nodes won't elect new leader until T + D + ε
```

Implementation:
```rust
struct LeaderLease {
    granted_at: Instant,
    duration: Duration,
    clock_epsilon: Duration, // Max clock skew
}

impl RaftLeader {
    fn acquire_lease(&mut self) -> Result<LeaderLease> {
        // Propose lease through Raft
        let lease_request = LeaseRequest {
            leader_id: self.id,
            duration: Duration::from_secs(10),
        };

        self.propose_and_commit(lease_request)?;

        Ok(LeaderLease {
            granted_at: Instant::now(),
            duration: Duration::from_secs(10),
            clock_epsilon: Duration::from_millis(100),
        })
    }

    fn can_serve_read_locally(&self) -> bool {
        if let Some(lease) = &self.current_lease {
            let now = Instant::now();
            let safe_until = lease.granted_at
                + lease.duration
                - lease.clock_epsilon;

            now < safe_until
        } else {
            false
        }
    }

    fn read(&mut self, key: &Key) -> Result<Value> {
        if self.can_serve_read_locally() {
            // Fast path: serve from local state
            return Ok(self.state_machine.read(key));
        }

        // Slow path: acquire new lease or use consensus read
        match self.try_renew_lease() {
            Ok(_) => Ok(self.state_machine.read(key)),
            Err(_) => self.consensus_read(key),
        }
    }
}
```

Follower Read Protocol (with leases):
```rust
impl RaftFollower {
    fn read(&mut self, key: &Key) -> Result<Value> {
        // Check how recent our data is
        let my_commit_index = self.commit_index;

        // Ask leader for commit index
        let leader_commit_index = self.request_commit_index()?;

        if my_commit_index >= leader_commit_index {
            // We're caught up! Safe to read locally
            return Ok(self.state_machine.read(key));
        }

        // Not caught up: forward to leader
        self.forward_to_leader(ReadRequest { key })
    }

    fn request_commit_index(&mut self) -> Result<u64> {
        // Leader can respond immediately (no consensus)
        // if it has valid lease
        self.send_rpc(LeaderCommitIndexRequest {})
    }
}
```

Performance Impact:
```
Workload: 90% reads, 10% writes

Without leases:
  Read latency: 10-15ms (consensus round trip)
  Read throughput: 10K reads/sec
  Leader CPU: 80%

With leases (10s duration):
  Read latency: 0.1-0.5ms (local read)
  Read throughput: 500K reads/sec
  Leader CPU: 15%

50x improvement on read-heavy workloads!
```

**Batching and Pipelining Strategies**

Multi-Raft Batching (TiKV implementation):
```rust
// TiKV runs 1000s of Raft groups per node
// Naive approach: Each group sends heartbeats independently
// Problem: 1000 groups * 5 nodes = 5000 messages/sec just for heartbeats!

struct MultiRaftBatcher {
    groups: Vec<RaftGroup>,
    batch_interval: Duration,
}

impl MultiRaftBatcher {
    fn run_batch_loop(&mut self) {
        let mut ticker = tokio::time::interval(self.batch_interval);

        loop {
            ticker.tick().await;

            // Collect all pending messages
            let mut messages_by_dest: HashMap<NodeID, Vec<RaftMessage>>
                = HashMap::new();

            for group in &mut self.groups {
                for msg in group.drain_pending_messages() {
                    messages_by_dest
                        .entry(msg.dest)
                        .or_insert_with(Vec::new)
                        .push(msg);
                }
            }

            // Send one batched message per destination
            for (dest, messages) in messages_by_dest {
                self.send_batch(dest, messages);
            }
        }
    }

    fn send_batch(&self, dest: NodeID, messages: Vec<RaftMessage>) {
        let batch = RaftMessageBatch {
            dest,
            messages, // All groups' messages combined
        };

        self.network.send(dest, batch);
    }
}

// Receiving side
impl MultiRaftReceiver {
    fn handle_batch(&mut self, batch: RaftMessageBatch) {
        // Process all messages in one go
        for msg in batch.messages {
            let group = &mut self.groups[msg.group_id];
            group.handle_message(msg);
        }
    }
}
```

Results:
```
TiKV cluster: 1000 Raft groups, 5 nodes

Without batching:
  Network packets/sec: 50,000
  CPU on networking: 25%
  Heartbeat latency: 10ms p99

With batching (10ms intervals):
  Network packets/sec: 500
  CPU on networking: 2%
  Heartbeat latency: 12ms p99 (slight increase, acceptable)

100x reduction in network overhead!
```

**Log Compaction Under Load**

The Problem:
```
Raft log grows forever without compaction
Compaction is expensive: blocks writes
Need: Compact without stopping the world
```

Incremental Compaction (CockroachDB approach):
```rust
struct IncrementalCompactor {
    state_machine: StateMachine,
    last_compacted_index: u64,
    compaction_progress: CompactionProgress,
}

struct CompactionProgress {
    snapshot: Option<InProgressSnapshot>,
    current_key: Option<Key>,
}

impl IncrementalCompactor {
    // Called periodically (e.g., every 100ms)
    fn incremental_compact(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        const KEYS_PER_ITERATION: usize = 1000;

        match &mut self.compaction_progress.snapshot {
            None => {
                // Start new snapshot
                self.compaction_progress.snapshot = Some(
                    self.state_machine.begin_snapshot()
                );
            }
            Some(snapshot) => {
                // Continue existing snapshot
                let start_key = self.compaction_progress.current_key
                    .as_ref()
                    .unwrap_or(&Key::min());

                // Copy next batch of keys
                let (keys_copied, next_key) = snapshot.copy_keys(
                    start_key,
                    KEYS_PER_ITERATION
                )?;

                if keys_copied < KEYS_PER_ITERATION {
                    // Snapshot complete!
                    self.finalize_snapshot(snapshot)?;
                    self.compaction_progress.snapshot = None;
                } else {
                    // More work to do
                    self.compaction_progress.current_key = Some(next_key);
                }
            }
        }

        Ok(())
    }

    fn finalize_snapshot(&mut self, snapshot: &InProgressSnapshot) -> Result<()> {
        // Atomically install new snapshot
        snapshot.finalize()?;

        // Truncate Raft log
        let snapshot_index = snapshot.last_included_index();
        self.raft.truncate_log_before(snapshot_index);

        self.last_compacted_index = snapshot_index;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

**Snapshot Transfer at Scale**

Problem: Transferring 100GB snapshot blocks new entries
```
Naive approach:
  1. Leader generates snapshot (10 minutes)
  2. Leader sends snapshot (30 minutes on slow link)
  3. Follower applies snapshot (10 minutes)
  Total: 50 minutes where follower can't catch up

Better approach: Streaming snapshots
```

Streaming Snapshot Protocol:
```rust
struct StreamingSnapshot {
    chunk_size: usize, // e.g., 4MB chunks
    chunks: Vec<SnapshotChunk>,
}

impl RaftLeader {
    async fn send_snapshot_streaming(
        &mut self,
        follower: NodeID
    ) -> Result<()> {
        // Open snapshot for streaming
        let snapshot = self.state_machine.open_snapshot_stream()?;

        // Send chunks in parallel with log replication
        let mut chunk_id = 0;
        while let Some(chunk) = snapshot.next_chunk().await {
            // Send chunk
            self.send_snapshot_chunk(follower, SnapshotChunk {
                id: chunk_id,
                data: chunk,
                is_last: false,
            })?;

            chunk_id += 1;

            // Yield: allow log entries to be sent
            tokio::task::yield_now().await;
        }

        // Send final chunk
        self.send_snapshot_chunk(follower, SnapshotChunk {
            id: chunk_id,
            data: vec![],
            is_last: true,
        })?;

        Ok(())
    }
}

impl RaftFollower {
    async fn receive_snapshot_streaming(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        let mut chunks = Vec::new();

        loop {
            tokio::select! {
                // Receive snapshot chunks
                chunk = self.recv_snapshot_chunk() => {
                    chunks.push(chunk?);

                    if chunk.is_last {
                        break;
                    }
                }

                // Continue processing log entries!
                entry = self.recv_log_entry() => {
                    self.buffer_entry(entry?);
                }
            }
        }

        // Apply complete snapshot
        self.apply_snapshot_chunks(chunks)?;

        // Apply buffered entries
        self.apply_buffered_entries()?;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### 5.5.3 Operational Challenges

**Leader Election Storms**

The Problem:
```
Production incident (real case, 2021):
  1. Network hiccup causes leader timeout
  2. Follower starts election (term 100)
  3. Wins, becomes leader
  4. Network hiccup again
  5. Another election (term 101)
  6. Repeat 50 times in 2 minutes
  7. No progress: all time spent on elections
```

Root Cause Analysis:
```rust
// Problematic configuration
const HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: Duration = Duration::from_millis(100);
const ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MIN: Duration = Duration::from_millis(150);
const ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MAX: Duration = Duration::from_millis(300);

// Problem: Not enough separation
// Network jitter: ~50ms p99
// Ratio: election_timeout / heartbeat = only 1.5x
// Too sensitive to network variance!
```

Solution - Pre-Vote Protocol (Raft §9):
```rust
enum VoteType {
    PreVote,    // Ask "would you vote for me?"
    RealVote,   // Actual election vote
}

impl RaftNode {
    fn handle_election_timeout(&mut self) {
        // Don't start real election immediately
        // First: ask if anyone would vote for us
        self.start_pre_vote();
    }

    fn start_pre_vote(&mut self) {
        let request = VoteRequest {
            candidate_id: self.id,
            term: self.current_term, // DON'T increment term!
            vote_type: VoteType::PreVote,
            last_log_index: self.log.last_index(),
            last_log_term: self.log.last_term(),
        };

        for peer in &self.peers {
            self.send_vote_request(peer, request.clone());
        }
    }

    fn handle_vote_request(&mut self, req: VoteRequest) -> VoteResponse {
        match req.vote_type {
            VoteType::PreVote => {
                // Would I vote for this candidate?
                if self.would_grant_vote(&req) {
                    return VoteResponse { vote_granted: true };
                } else {
                    return VoteResponse { vote_granted: false };
                }
                // Key: DON'T actually grant vote or increment term
            }
            VoteType::RealVote => {
                // Normal Raft voting logic
                self.grant_vote_if_valid(req)
            }
        }
    }

    fn handle_pre_vote_responses(&mut self, responses: Vec<VoteResponse>) {
        let votes = responses.iter().filter(|r| r.vote_granted).count();

        if votes >= self.quorum_size() {
            // Majority would vote for us: start real election
            self.start_real_election();
        } else {
            // Wouldn't win anyway: don't disrupt cluster
            self.reset_election_timer();
        }
    }
}
```

Impact:
```
Before pre-vote:
  - Elections during transient partitions: 50+/hour
  - Availability: 99.5%
  - P99 latency: 500ms (due to election disruption)

After pre-vote:
  - Elections during transient partitions: 0-1/hour
  - Availability: 99.95%
  - P99 latency: 50ms
```

**Network Partition Recovery**

The Scenario:
```
5-node cluster: A, B, C in DC1; D, E in DC2
Network partition: DC1 <-> DC2

DC1 group (A, B, C):
  - Has majority (3/5)
  - Elects leader (A)
  - Continues processing writes
  - Log advances to index 1,000,000

DC2 group (D, E):
  - No majority (2/5)
  - Cannot elect leader
  - Cannot process writes
  - Stuck at index 500,000

Partition heals after 1 hour:
  - D and E are 500,000 entries behind!
  - Naive catch-up: Send all 500,000 entries
  - At 10,000 entries/sec: 50 seconds
  - But: cluster still processing new writes
  - D and E never catch up!
```

Solution - Snapshot on Recovery:
```rust
impl RaftLeader {
    fn handle_append_entries_response(
        &mut self,
        follower: NodeID,
        resp: AppendEntriesResponse
    ) {
        if !resp.success {
            // Follower rejected entries

            if self.match_index[follower] < self.snapshot_index {
                // Follower is too far behind
                // Send snapshot instead of individual entries
                self.send_snapshot(follower);
            } else {
                // Follower is only slightly behind
                // Back up and retry with earlier entries
                self.next_index[follower] -= 1;
                self.retry_append_entries(follower);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Optimized Recovery with Parallel Transfer:
```rust
impl RaftLeader {
    async fn fast_follower_recovery(
        &mut self,
        follower: NodeID
    ) -> Result<()> {
        let follower_index = self.match_index[follower];
        let leader_index = self.commit_index;
        let gap = leader_index - follower_index;

        if gap > SNAPSHOT_THRESHOLD {
            // Send snapshot + ongoing entries in parallel

            // Task 1: Stream snapshot
            let snapshot_task = tokio::spawn(async move {
                self.send_snapshot_streaming(follower).await
            });

            // Task 2: Buffer new entries
            let entry_buffer = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::new()));
            let entry_task = tokio::spawn(async move {
                while snapshot_task.is_running() {
                    let new_entries = self.log.entries_since(leader_index);
                    entry_buffer.lock().unwrap().extend(new_entries);
                    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
                }
            });

            // Wait for snapshot
            snapshot_task.await?;

            // Send buffered entries
            let buffered = entry_buffer.lock().unwrap();
            self.send_entries(follower, &buffered)?;

            Ok(())
        } else {
            // Normal catch-up with entries
            self.send_entries_incremental(follower)
        }
    }
}
```

## Chapter 6: From Clocks to Causality

### 6.1 Physical Time Era (1980s-2000s)

#### 6.1.1 Early Attempts

**NTP Deployment (1985)**

Network Time Protocol Origins:
- Developed by David Mills at University of Delaware
- Goal: Synchronize clocks over unreliable networks
- Hierarchical stratum architecture

Architecture:
```
Stratum 0: Reference clocks (atomic clocks, GPS)
Stratum 1: Directly connected to stratum 0
Stratum 2: Sync from stratum 1 servers
...
Stratum 15: Max depth
Stratum 16: Unsynchronized
```

Synchronization Algorithm:
```python
class NTPClient:
    def sync_with_server(self, server):
        # 1. Record local time when sending request
        t1 = self.local_clock.now()

        # 2. Send request
        request = NTPRequest(client_time=t1)
        self.send(server, request)

        # 3. Server receives at t2, sends reply at t3
        response = self.receive_from(server)
        t2 = response.receive_time
        t3 = response.transmit_time

        # 4. Client receives at t4
        t4 = self.local_clock.now()

        # Calculate offset and delay
        offset = ((t2 - t1) + (t3 - t4)) / 2
        delay = (t4 - t1) - (t3 - t2)

        # Adjust local clock
        if abs(offset) < THRESHOLD:
            self.local_clock.adjust_gradually(offset)
        else:
            self.local_clock.set(t4 + offset)

        return offset, delay
```

Performance:
- Public internet: 5-100ms accuracy
- LAN: 1-10ms accuracy
- Problem: Too coarse for distributed transactions

**Timestamp Ordering (1979)**

Distributed Database Technique:
- Every transaction gets timestamp
- Execute in timestamp order
- Ensure serializability

Protocol:
```
For each transaction T with timestamp TS(T):

Read rule:
  - Can read X if no transaction with TS > TS(T) has written X
  - Otherwise: abort T

Write rule:
  - Can write X if no transaction with TS > TS(T) has read/written X
  - Otherwise: abort T
```

Example Scenario:
```
T1 (TS=100): Write(X, v1)
T2 (TS=101): Read(X)

If T2 reads before T1 writes:
  - T2 would see old value
  - Violates timestamp order
  - Must abort T2 and restart with new TS
```

Problems:
- High abort rate with clock skew
- Cascading aborts
- Unrestricted aborts → livelock possible

**Thomas Write Rule (1979)**

Optimization: Ignore outdated writes

Standard rule:
```
If TS(T) < TS(last_write(X)):
  Abort T
```

Thomas Write Rule:
```
If TS(T) < TS(last_write(X)):
  Ignore this write (don't abort!)
  Reasoning: Later transaction already wrote
```

Benefits:
- Fewer aborts
- Better performance

Downside:
- Non-serializable schedule possible
- View-serializability only

**Berkeley Algorithm (1989)**

Idea: Don't trust any clock, average them

Protocol:
```
1. Master polls all slaves for their time
2. Master estimates slave times (accounting for network delay)
3. Master computes average
4. Master sends adjustment to each slave

Example:
  Master thinks it's 12:00:00
  Slave 1 reports 12:00:05
  Slave 2 reports 11:59:55
  Slave 3 reports 12:00:02

  Average: 12:00:00.5
  Adjustments:
    Master: +0.5 seconds
    Slave 1: -4.5 seconds
    Slave 2: +5.5 seconds
    Slave 3: -1.5 seconds
```

Problems:
- Master is single point of failure
- Assumes symmetric network delays
- Byzantine faults not tolerated

#### 6.1.2 Failure Analysis

**Clock Skew Impacts**

Real-world Example 1: Database Corruption (2010)
```
Setup: Multi-master database with timestamp ordering

Timeline:
  12:00:00.00 (Server A): Write(X, v1) [TS=100]
  12:00:00.10 (Server B): Write(X, v2) [TS=95] (clock skew!)

Result:
  - Server A's write has higher TS
  - But Server B's write might be seen first
  - Replicas disagree on final value
  - Data corruption

Impact:
  - 3 hours downtime
  - Manual reconciliation needed
  - $500K revenue loss
```

Real-world Example 2: Kerberos Failures (2015)
```
Setup: Authentication service with 5-minute clock skew tolerance

Scenario:
  Client clock: 12:00:00
  Server clock: 12:06:00 (6-minute skew)

Result:
  - All tickets rejected as "too far in past"
  - Authentication fails
  - Service outage

Root cause: NTP server misconfiguration
Fix time: 45 minutes
```

**Inversion Examples**

Causality Violation:
```
Event sequence:
  1. User A posts "Hello" at 12:00:00 (Server 1, clock skewed +5 min)
  2. User B replies "Hi!" at 12:01:00 (Server 2, correct clock)

Display order (sorted by timestamp):
  1. "Hi!" (12:01:00)
  2. "Hello" (12:05:00)

Result: Reply appears before original message!
```

Make-Before-Break Violation:
```
Distributed build system:

Node A compiles lib.c → lib.o (TS: 12:00:00, clock +5 min)
Node B compiles main.c → main.o (TS: 11:59:00, correct clock)
Node C links main.o + lib.o → binary

Node C sees:
  - lib.o timestamp: 12:00:00
  - main.o timestamp: 11:59:00
  - Thinks lib.o changed after link
  - Spurious rebuild!
```

**Lessons Learned**

Key Insights:
1. Physical clocks are unreliable
   - Crystal oscillator drift: 10-100 PPM
   - Temperature affects drift rate
   - Virtualization makes it worse

2. Network delays are unpredictable
   - NTP assumes symmetric delay
   - Reality: Asymmetric paths common
   - Bufferbloat adds variance

3. Clock synchronization is hard
   - NTP good for humans, not transactions
   - GPS vulnerable to spoofing
   - Need better solution for strong consistency

4. Foundation for logical time
   - If can't trust physical time, use logical time
   - Lamport clocks (1978) already existed
   - But took decades to see production adoption

### 6.2 Logical Time Revolution (1990s-2010s)

#### 6.2.1 Lamport Clock Applications

**Lamport Timestamps (1978)**

Core Idea: Capture causality, not wall-clock time

Rules:
```
1. Each process maintains counter LC
2. Before event: LC = LC + 1
3. On send: include LC in message
4. On receive: LC = max(LC, msg.LC) + 1
```

Property: If event A → event B (causally), then LC(A) < LC(B)
Limitation: LC(A) < LC(B) doesn't imply A → B (false positives)

**Distributed Debugging**

Problem: Understanding causality in distributed traces

Implementation:
```python
class DistributedTracer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lamport_clock = 0
        self.events = []

    def log_event(self, event_type, data):
        self.lamport_clock += 1
        event = Event(
            timestamp=self.lamport_clock,
            wall_clock=time.time(),
            type=event_type,
            data=data
        )
        self.events.append(event)
        return event

    def send_message(self, dest, payload):
        event = self.log_event("send", {"dest": dest, "payload": payload})
        message = Message(
            payload=payload,
            lamport_ts=self.lamport_clock
        )
        self.network.send(dest, message)

    def receive_message(self, message):
        self.lamport_clock = max(self.lamport_clock, message.lamport_ts)
        self.log_event("receive", {"payload": message.payload})
```

Trace Analysis:
```
Service A events:
  [LC=1] Request received
  [LC=2] Query database
  [LC=3] Send to Service B

Service B events:
  [LC=4] Receive from A (max(local, 3) + 1 = 4)
  [LC=5] Process request
  [LC=6] Send to Service C

Can now reconstruct causal order regardless of clock skew!
```

**Mutual Exclusion**

Lamport's Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithm (1978):

Protocol:
```
To acquire lock:
  1. Increment LC, add request to local queue
  2. Broadcast REQUEST(LC, process_id) to all
  3. Wait for REPLY from all other processes
  4. Enter critical section when:
     - Own request is at head of queue
     - Received REPLY from all with higher timestamp

To release lock:
  1. Remove request from queue
  2. Broadcast RELEASE to all

On receiving REQUEST:
  1. Add to local queue
  2. Send REPLY

On receiving RELEASE:
  1. Remove from local queue
```

Total Order: Use (LC, process_id) pairs, break ties by ID

Example:
```
Process A: REQUEST(10, A)
Process B: REQUEST(10, B)
Process C: REQUEST(12, C)

Order: A → B → C (tie broken by process ID)
```

**Snapshot Algorithms**

Chandy-Lamport Snapshot (1985):

Problem: How to capture consistent global state?

Protocol:
```
Initiator:
  1. Records own state
  2. Sends MARKER on all outgoing channels
  3. Starts recording incoming messages

Other processes (on receiving first MARKER):
  1. Records own state
  2. Records channel state (messages received before MARKER)
  3. Sends MARKER on all outgoing channels
  4. Starts recording other incoming messages
```

Example:
```
P1 ---MARKER---> P2
        |
        v
       P3

Snapshot captures:
- State of P1, P2, P3
- Messages in flight when MARKER initiated
- Consistent cut (no "effect before cause")
```

Used in:
- Distributed debugging (Fidge, 1989)
- Checkpointing (Elnozahy et al., 2002)
- Global predicate detection

#### 6.2.2 Vector Clocks in Production

**Amazon Dynamo (2007)**

Why Vector Clocks:
- Dynamo is eventually consistent
- Need to detect conflicts
- Lamport clocks insufficient (can't detect concurrency)

Vector Clock Definition:
```
For N nodes, each node i maintains:
  VC[i] = [c1, c2, ..., cN]

Rules:
  1. Before event: VC[i][i] += 1
  2. On send: include VC[i] in message
  3. On receive from j:
     VC[i][k] = max(VC[i][k], VC[j][k]) for all k
     VC[i][i] += 1
```

Comparison:
```
VC1 < VC2 if: VC1[k] ≤ VC2[k] for all k, and exists k where VC1[k] < VC2[k]
VC1 || VC2 if: Neither VC1 < VC2 nor VC2 < VC1 (concurrent!)
```

Dynamo Implementation:
```python
class DynamoNode:
    def __init__(self, node_id, num_nodes):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.vector_clock = [0] * num_nodes

    def put(self, key, value):
        # Increment own clock
        self.vector_clock[self.node_id] += 1

        # Create versioned object
        obj = VersionedObject(
            key=key,
            value=value,
            vector_clock=self.vector_clock.copy()
        )

        # Replicate to N nodes
        self.replicate(obj)

    def get(self, key):
        # Read from multiple replicas
        versions = self.read_replicas(key)

        # Find concurrent versions
        concurrent = self.find_concurrent_versions(versions)

        if len(concurrent) == 1:
            return concurrent[0]
        else:
            # Conflict! Return all versions to client
            return concurrent

    def find_concurrent_versions(self, versions):
        """Remove dominated versions"""
        concurrent = []

        for v1 in versions:
            dominated = False
            for v2 in versions:
                if v1 != v2 and self.happens_before(v1.vc, v2.vc):
                    dominated = True
                    break

            if not dominated:
                concurrent.append(v1)

        return concurrent

    def happens_before(self, vc1, vc2):
        """Check if vc1 < vc2"""
        less_equal = all(vc1[i] <= vc2[i] for i in range(len(vc1)))
        strictly_less = any(vc1[i] < vc2[i] for i in range(len(vc1)))
        return less_equal and strictly_less
```

Example Scenario:
```
Initial: X = v0, VC = [0, 0, 0]

Node 1 writes: X = v1, VC = [1, 0, 0]
Node 2 writes: X = v2, VC = [0, 1, 0]

Get(X) returns both:
  - (v1, [1, 0, 0])
  - (v2, [0, 1, 0])

Concurrent! Client must resolve (e.g., merge shopping carts)

Client writes merged: X = v3, VC = [1, 1, 0]
Now [1, 0, 0] < [1, 1, 0] and [0, 1, 0] < [1, 1, 0]
Conflict resolved!
```

**Riak Implementation (2009)**

Evolution from Dynamo:
- Open-source Dynamo-inspired
- Vector clocks for sibling resolution
- But: Vector clock growth problems

Per-Key Vector Clocks:
```
Key: "user:123"
Value: {name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com"}
Vector Clock: [
  {node: "riak1", counter: 5},
  {node: "riak2", counter: 3},
  {node: "riak3", counter: 1}
]
```

Growth Problem:
```
Scenario: Load balancer distributes requests across many nodes

Time T1: Node A writes, VC = [A:1]
Time T2: Node B writes, VC = [A:1, B:1]
Time T3: Node C writes, VC = [A:1, B:1, C:1]
...
Time T100: 100 nodes have touched this key, VC has 100 entries!

Per-object overhead:
  - Small value (100 bytes)
  - Vector clock (100 * 20 bytes = 2000 bytes)
  - 20x overhead!
```

**Trimming Strategies**

**Top-K Nodes**

Keep only K most recent nodes:
```python
MAX_VECTOR_CLOCK_SIZE = 10

def trim_vector_clock(vc):
    if len(vc) <= MAX_VECTOR_CLOCK_SIZE:
        return vc

    # Sort by counter value (recency proxy)
    sorted_entries = sorted(vc.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Keep top K
    return dict(sorted_entries[:MAX_VECTOR_CLOCK_SIZE])
```

Downside: Loses causality information, may create false conflicts

**Time Windows**

Remove entries older than T:
```python
import time

def trim_old_entries(vc, max_age_seconds=3600):
    now = time.time()
    return {
        node: (counter, timestamp)
        for node, (counter, timestamp) in vc.items()
        if now - timestamp < max_age_seconds
    }
```

Downside: Requires wall-clock time (defeats purpose of vector clocks)

**Causal Stability Detection**

Key Insight: If all nodes have seen event E, E is causally stable

Protocol:
```python
class CausalStability:
    def __init__(self, node_id, nodes):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.local_vc = {n: 0 for n in nodes}
        self.min_vc = {n: 0 for n in nodes}

    def on_event(self):
        self.local_vc[self.node_id] += 1

    def on_heartbeat_send(self):
        """Send local VC to all nodes"""
        return self.local_vc.copy()

    def on_heartbeat_receive(self, from_node, their_vc):
        """Update min seen by all"""
        # Update our view of from_node's VC
        self.received_vcs[from_node] = their_vc

        # Compute minimum across all nodes
        for node in self.nodes:
            self.min_vc[node] = min(
                vc.get(node, 0)
                for vc in self.received_vcs.values()
            )

    def is_stable(self, event_vc):
        """Check if event is stable (all nodes have seen it)"""
        for node in self.nodes:
            if event_vc.get(node, 0) > self.min_vc[node]:
                return False
        return True

    def garbage_collect(self):
        """Remove stable entries from vector clocks"""
        # Can remove entries with counter <= min_vc
        # All nodes have progressed past these points
        pass
```

Usage in Riak:
- Periodic stability detection
- Compact vector clocks by removing stable entries
- Reduces growth significantly

Performance Impact:
```
Before stability GC:
  - Average VC size: 50 entries
  - 95th percentile: 100 entries
  - Storage overhead: ~40%

After stability GC:
  - Average VC size: 8 entries
  - 95th percentile: 15 entries
  - Storage overhead: ~6%

Tradeoff: Periodic gossip overhead
```

#### 6.2.3 Advanced Structures

**Interval Tree Clocks (2008)**

Problem: Vector clocks don't handle dynamic node sets well

Innovation: Represent causality as interval tree

Structure:
```
Each node has ID from interval [0, 1)

Example:
  Node A: [0, 0.5)
  Node B: [0.5, 1)

Node A splits:
  A1: [0, 0.25)
  A2: [0.25, 0.5)

Clock: (interval, counter)
```

Benefits:
- Dynamic node join/leave
- Bounded size
- Full causality tracking

Downside:
- More complex implementation
- Not widely adopted

**Matrix Clocks**

Extension: Track what each node knows about others

Structure:
```
Node i maintains N×N matrix M:
  M[i][j][k] = "What node i knows about node j's knowledge of node k"
```

Applications:
- Garbage collection
- Consistent snapshots
- Distributed debugging

Overhead: O(N^2) space

**Bloom Clocks (2014)**

Idea: Use Bloom filter to approximate vector clock

Structure:
```python
class BloomClock:
    def __init__(self, size=1024, num_hashes=3):
        self.bloom_filter = [0] * size
        self.num_hashes = num_hashes
        self.counter = 0

    def increment(self, node_id):
        self.counter += 1
        for i in range(self.num_hashes):
            h = hash(f"{node_id}:{self.counter}:{i}") % len(self.bloom_filter)
            self.bloom_filter[h] = 1

    def happens_before(self, other):
        # Approximate: Check if all our 1s are in other
        for i, bit in enumerate(self.bloom_filter):
            if bit == 1 and other.bloom_filter[i] == 0:
                return False
        return True
```

Benefits:
- Fixed size
- Faster comparisons

Downside:
- False positives possible
- Can't be used for exact causality

**Version Vectors**

Simpler than vector clocks: Per-replica version counter

Used in:
- CouchDB
- Cassandra
- Voldemort

Difference from Vector Clocks:
```
Vector Clock: Tracks events
Version Vector: Tracks replicas that modified object

Example:
  Version Vector: {r1: 5, r3: 2}
  Means: Replica r1 modified 5 times, r3 modified 2 times
  Does NOT track r2 (never modified this object)

Vector Clock: {n1: 5, n2: 7, n3: 2}
  Tracks all nodes in system, even if not modified object

### 6.3 Hybrid Time Systems (2010s-2025)

#### 6.3.1 HLC in Production

**Hybrid Logical Clocks (2014)**

Innovation: Combine physical time with logical causality

Structure:
```python
class HLC:
    def __init__(self):
        self.physical_time = 0  # From system clock
        self.logical_time = 0   # Logical counter

    def now(self):
        pt = self.system_clock()
        if pt > self.physical_time:
            self.physical_time = pt
            self.logical_time = 0
        else:
            self.logical_time += 1

        return (self.physical_time, self.logical_time)

    def update(self, msg_pt, msg_lt):
        """On receiving message"""
        pt = self.system_clock()

        if pt > max(self.physical_time, msg_pt):
            self.physical_time = pt
            self.logical_time = 0
        elif self.physical_time > msg_pt:
            self.logical_time += 1
        elif msg_pt > self.physical_time:
            self.physical_time = msg_pt
            self.logical_time = msg_lt + 1
        else:  # msg_pt == self.physical_time
            self.logical_time = max(self.logical_time, msg_lt) + 1
```

Properties:
- Respects causality (like Lamport clocks)
- Bounded by physical time (within clock skew δ)
- Fixed size (unlike vector clocks)

**CockroachDB Design**

Why HLC:
- Need serializable transactions
- Multi-region deployment
- Can't assume TrueTime hardware

Architecture:
```
Each node maintains HLC:
  (wall_time, logical_counter)

Transaction timestamps:
  - Start time: HLC at transaction begin
  - Commit time: HLC at commit (may be pushed forward)

MVCC Storage:
  - Every row version tagged with HLC timestamp
  - Read at timestamp T sees versions with HLC ≤ T
```

Implementation:
```go
// Simplified CockroachDB HLC
type HLC struct {
    wallTime  int64  // nanoseconds since epoch
    logical   int32  // logical counter
    maxOffset int64  // maximum clock offset bound
}

func (h *HLC) Now() HLC {
    pt := time.Now().UnixNano()

    if pt > h.wallTime {
        return HLC{wallTime: pt, logical: 0, maxOffset: h.maxOffset}
    }

    return HLC{wallTime: h.wallTime, logical: h.logical + 1, maxOffset: h.maxOffset}
}

func (h *HLC) Update(remote HLC) {
    pt := time.Now().UnixNano()

    if pt > h.wallTime && pt > remote.wallTime {
        h.wallTime = pt
        h.logical = 0
    } else if h.wallTime > remote.wallTime {
        h.logical++
    } else if remote.wallTime > h.wallTime {
        h.wallTime = remote.wallTime
        h.logical = remote.logical + 1
    } else {
        h.logical = max(h.logical, remote.logical) + 1
    }

    // Check if clock offset is within bounds
    if abs(pt - h.wallTime) > h.maxOffset {
        panic("clock offset too large")
    }
}
```

Clock Offset Monitoring:
```sql
-- CockroachDB tracks clock offsets
SELECT node_id, clock_offset_ms
FROM crdb_internal.gossip_liveness
WHERE clock_offset_ms > 500;  -- Alert if > 500ms
```

**Cross-Service HLC Propagation Patterns**

Pattern 1: Request-Response
```python
class ServiceA:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hlc = HLC()

    def handle_request(self, data):
        # Assign timestamp to operation
        ts = self.hlc.now()

        # Process request
        result = self.process(data, ts)

        # Send to Service B
        response = self.call_service_b(result, ts)

        return response

class ServiceB:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hlc = HLC()

    def handle_request(self, data, sender_ts):
        # Update HLC with sender's timestamp
        self.hlc.update(sender_ts.pt, sender_ts.lt)

        # Assign new timestamp
        ts = self.hlc.now()

        # Process
        result = self.process(data, ts)

        return result
```

Pattern 2: Event Streaming
```python
class Producer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hlc = HLC()

    def publish_event(self, event):
        ts = self.hlc.now()
        message = Message(
            data=event,
            timestamp=ts
        )
        self.kafka.send(message)

class Consumer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hlc = HLC()

    def process_event(self, message):
        # Update HLC before processing
        self.hlc.update(message.timestamp.pt, message.timestamp.lt)

        # Causality preserved!
        ts = self.hlc.now()
        self.process(message.data, ts)
```

Pattern 3: Database Writes
```python
class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hlc = HLC()
        self.db = CockroachDB()

    def write_transaction(self):
        ts = self.hlc.now()

        with self.db.transaction() as txn:
            # Write with explicit timestamp
            txn.write("key", "value", timestamp=ts)

            # DB may push timestamp forward (write-write conflict)
            commit_ts = txn.commit()

            # Update local HLC with commit timestamp
            self.hlc.update(commit_ts.pt, commit_ts.lt)
```

Production Considerations:
```
Clock Skew Monitoring:
  - Alert if skew > 250ms
  - Reject requests if skew > 500ms
  - Prevents unbounded logical counter growth

Logical Counter Growth:
  - Should reset to 0 frequently (when physical time advances)
  - If logical counter > 1000: sign of clock issues
  - Monitor and alert

Timestamp Propagation:
  - Always propagate HLC in RPC headers
  - Update HLC on every message receive
  - Maintains causal consistency across services
```

**MongoDB Implementation (2018)**

MongoDB Replica Sets with HLC:
```
Primary:
  - Assigns HLC timestamp to each operation
  - Writes to oplog with HLC timestamp

Secondaries:
  - Replay oplog in HLC order
  - Update own HLC as operations replay
  - Ensures causal consistency

Causal Consistency Sessions:
  - Client reads see own writes
  - Tracked via HLC timestamps
```

Session Example:
```javascript
// Client session with causal consistency
session = client.startSession({causalConsistency: true});

// Write operation
result = session.db.users.insertOne({name: "Alice"});
// Server returns HLC timestamp: (1234567890, 0)

// Read operation must see the write
user = session.db.users.findOne({name: "Alice"}, {
  readConcern: {
    level: "majority",
    afterClusterTime: result.operationTime  // HLC timestamp
  }
});
// Guaranteed to see "Alice"!
```

**YugabyteDB Approach (2019)**

Hybrid Time in Distributed SQL:
```
HT (Hybrid Time) = (physical_time, logical_counter)

Tablet servers:
  - Each tablet has HT
  - Transaction coordinators track HT
  - MVCC storage with HT as version

Read operations:
  - Pick read_time = HT.now()
  - See snapshot at read_time
  - Follower reads: use safe_time (highest committed HT)

Write operations:
  - Acquire locks
  - Assign commit_time = HT.now()
  - Ensure commit_time > all read_times in transaction
```

Compared to CockroachDB:
```
CockroachDB:
  - HLC for causality
  - Linearizability via leases

YugabyteDB:
  - HT (similar to HLC)
  - Linearizability via Raft timestamps
  - Tighter integration with Raft
```

#### 6.3.2 TrueTime Operations

**Hardware Setup**

Google's TrueTime Architecture:
```
Time Master Servers:
  - GPS receivers (directly attached)
    - Outdoor antenna
    - PCI card with GPS receiver
    - Atomic clock as backup
  - Atomic clocks (rubidium/cesium)
    - Expensive (~$10K-$50K each)
    - Drift: < 1ms per year

  Per datacenter:
    - Multiple time masters (redundancy)
    - Connected to different GPS satellites

Time Slave Servers:
  - Every machine runs time daemon
  - Polls multiple time masters
  - Applies Marzullo's algorithm
  - Computes uncertainty bound ε
```

Network Topology:
```
                [GPS Satellites]
                       |
          [Time Masters (GPS + Atomic Clocks)]
                       |
              [Datacenter Network]
                       |
     [Time Slaves (All Spanner Servers)]
```

**Software Stack**

TrueTime API:
```cpp
// Simplified TrueTime API
struct TTInterval {
    int64 earliest;  // Earliest possible current time
    int64 latest;    // Latest possible current time
};

class TrueTime {
public:
    // Returns interval containing current time
    static TTInterval Now() {
        int64 now = PhysicalClock::now();
        int64 epsilon = ComputeUncertainty();

        return TTInterval{
            .earliest = now - epsilon,
            .latest = now + epsilon
        };
    }

    // Check if time t has definitely passed
    static bool After(int64 t) {
        return Now().earliest > t;
    }

    // Check if time t has definitely not arrived
    static bool Before(int64 t) {
        return Now().latest < t;
    }
};
```

Uncertainty Calculation:
```python
def compute_uncertainty():
    """Calculate ε (uncertainty bound)"""
    # Poll multiple time masters
    master_responses = []
    for master in TIME_MASTERS:
        response = poll_time_master(master)
        master_responses.append(response)

    # Apply Marzullo's algorithm
    # Finds smallest interval intersecting most responses
    interval = marzullos_algorithm(master_responses)

    # Add network uncertainty
    network_delay = estimate_network_delay()

    # Add local clock drift
    time_since_last_sync = now() - last_sync_time
    drift_rate = 200e-6  # 200 ppm
    drift = time_since_last_sync * drift_rate

    epsilon = (interval.width / 2) + network_delay + drift

    return epsilon
```

**Monitoring ε**

Production Metrics:
```
Normal operation:
  ε (epsilon): 1-7 ms typical
  Distribution:
    p50: 2 ms
    p99: 6 ms
    p99.9: 10 ms

Time sync daemon runs every 30 seconds
Sawtooth pattern in ε:
  - Minimum: Right after sync (1 ms)
  - Maximum: Just before next sync (7 ms)
```

Monitoring Dashboard:
```python
# Prometheus metrics
truetime_epsilon_ms
truetime_sync_status (0=healthy, 1=unhealthy)
truetime_masters_available
truetime_gps_lock_status

# Alerts
if truetime_epsilon_ms > 10:
    alert("TrueTime epsilon too large")

if truetime_masters_available < 2:
    alert("Insufficient time masters")

if truetime_gps_lock_status == 0:
    alert("GPS lock lost")
```

**Incident Response**

**Scenario 1: ε Inflation (GPS Outage)**

Timeline:
```
T+0:  GPS signals jammed (solar flare)
T+5m: Time masters switch to atomic clocks
      ε starts growing (only atomic clock, no GPS correction)

T+1h: ε = 50ms (vs normal 5ms)
      Alert triggered

T+2h: ε = 100ms
      Operations slowed (more commit-wait)
      Throughput: 100K TPS → 80K TPS

T+6h: GPS restored
      ε drops back to 5ms
```

Response Playbook:
```
1. Verify time master health
   - Check GPS lock status
   - Check atomic clock drift
   - Verify network connectivity

2. If ε > 50ms:
   - Consider shedding load
   - Increase request timeouts
   - Notify dependent services

3. If ε > 100ms (rare):
   - Seriously consider taking datacenter offline
   - Route traffic to other regions
   - Risk of correctness violations

4. Post-incident:
   - Review GPS antenna placement
   - Check for RF interference
   - Validate atomic clock calibration
```

**Scenario 2: Smeared Leap Second**

Problem: Leap seconds cause time to jump backward

Google's Solution: Smear leap second over 24 hours
```
Normal: 23:59:59 → 23:59:60 → 00:00:00 (1 second jump)

Smeared: Slow clock by 1/86400 for 24 hours
  - Clock runs 0.0011% slower
  - Distributes 1 second over full day
  - No backward jump!
```

Impact on ε:
```
During smear window:
  - ε slightly larger (clock skew between smeared and non-smeared)
  - Typically: 5ms → 8ms
  - Acceptable increase

TrueTime accounts for smearing automatically
```

#### 6.3.3 Bounded Uncertainty

**Commit-Wait Calculations**

Spanner's Commit Protocol:
```python
def commit_transaction(transaction):
    # 1. Acquire locks
    locks = acquire_locks(transaction.writes)

    # 2. Pick commit timestamp
    tt = TrueTime.Now()
    commit_ts = tt.latest  # Use latest possible time

    # 3. Apply writes at Paxos leader
    paxos_leader.replicate(transaction.writes, commit_ts)

    # 4. COMMIT-WAIT
    # Wait until commit_ts is guaranteed in the past
    while not TrueTime.After(commit_ts):
        sleep(0.1ms)  # Busy-wait

    # 5. Release locks and return
    release_locks(locks)
    return commit_ts
```

Why Commit-Wait:
```
Without commit-wait:

T1 at Server A:
  commits at ts=100
  returns immediately
  Client sees commit

T2 at Server B:
  starts at ts=99 (clock skew!)
  doesn't see T1's writes
  Violates external consistency!

With commit-wait:

T1 at Server A:
  commits at ts=100
  waits until TrueTime.Now().earliest > 100
  (waits ~7ms in practice)
  then returns
  Now all servers' clocks must be > 100
  T2 will see T1's writes!
```

**Read Timestamp Selection**

Strong Reads (Linearizable):
```python
def read_strong(key):
    # Read at current time
    tt = TrueTime.Now()
    read_ts = tt.latest  # Must be safe

    # Read from Paxos leader (or quorum)
    value = paxos_leader.read_at(key, read_ts)

    return value
```

Cost: Must contact leader (cross-datacenter for geo-distributed)

**Follower Read Optimization**

Idea: Read from nearby follower if timestamp is old enough

Safe Time Calculation:
```python
class PaxosFollower:
    def __init__(self):
        self.last_applied = 0  # Highest timestamp applied
        self.safe_time = 0     # Highest timestamp safe to read

    def update_safe_time(self):
        """Called periodically"""
        tt = TrueTime.Now()

        # Safe time = last_applied, unless leader has prepared later writes
        # For simplicity: safe_time = last_applied
        self.safe_time = self.last_applied

    def read_at(self, key, read_ts):
        if read_ts > self.safe_time:
            return "not ready, read from leader"

        # Safe to read locally!
        return self.mvcc_storage.read(key, read_ts)
```

Bounded Staleness Reads:
```python
def read_with_staleness(key, max_staleness_ms):
    # Read from past
    read_ts = TrueTime.Now().earliest - max_staleness_ms * 1e6

    # Find nearest follower
    follower = find_nearest_follower()

    # Read from follower (usually local)
    value = follower.read_at(key, read_ts)

    return value
```

Benefits:
- Low latency (local datacenter)
- High throughput (no leader bottleneck)
- Bounded staleness (max_staleness_ms parameter)

**Clock Domain Boundaries**

Problem: Different systems have different time semantics

Clock Domains:
```
Domain 1: TrueTime (Google Spanner)
  - Bounded uncertainty
  - Commit-wait protocol
  - External consistency

Domain 2: NTP (External clients)
  - Unbounded uncertainty
  - No guarantees

Domain 3: TSO (Oracle RAC)
  - Centralized timestamp oracle
  - Different guarantees
```

Crossing Boundaries:
```python
def external_client_read(key):
    """Client with NTP clock reads from Spanner"""

    # Option 1: Strong read (always consistent)
    tt = TrueTime.Now()
    read_ts = tt.latest
    return spanner.read_strong(key, read_ts)

    # Option 2: Client provides timestamp (risky!)
    client_ts = client.clock.now()
    # Problem: client_ts might be in future
    # Could violate consistency

def safe_cross_domain_read(key):
    """Safe approach"""
    # Always use server's time authority
    # Don't trust client clocks for consistency
    return spanner.read_strong(key)
```

Best Practices:
1. Never mix time authorities within consistency domain
2. Use server-assigned timestamps for distributed transactions
3. Client timestamps OK for idempotency, not consistency
4. Document clock assumptions clearly

**Roughtime (2016)**

Evolution: Public NTP replacement

Problems with NTP:
- No authentication (spoofing possible)
- Single time source
- Can't detect malicious time server

Roughtime Solution:
```
Multi-source validation:
  - Client queries multiple servers
  - Servers sign responses
  - Client computes intersection
  - Detects malicious/broken servers

Merkle tree for accountability:
  - Server commits to batch of responses
  - Publishes root hash
  - Clients can prove server's response
  - Public audit trail
```

Protocol:
```python
class RoughtimeClient:
    def sync(self, servers):
        responses = []

        # Query multiple servers
        for server in servers:
            response = self.query_server(server)
            # Response: (midpoint, radius, signature)
            if self.verify_signature(response, server.public_key):
                responses.append(response)

        # Compute intersection
        intervals = [
            (r.midpoint - r.radius, r.midpoint + r.radius)
            for r in responses
        ]

        intersection = self.compute_intersection(intervals)

        if intersection is None:
            raise "No consistent time from servers!"

        # Use midpoint of intersection
        time = (intersection[0] + intersection[1]) / 2
        uncertainty = (intersection[1] - intersection[0]) / 2

        return (time, uncertainty)
```

Deployment Status (2024):
- Cloudflare runs public Roughtime servers
- Google runs Roughtime servers
- Used by Android, Chrome OS
- Gradual adoption vs NTP

**PTP (Precision Time Protocol)**

IEEE 1588 for sub-microsecond sync

Architecture:
```
Grandmaster Clock:
  - High-quality oscillator (GPS or atomic)
  - Source of time for domain

Boundary Clocks:
  - Forwarding nodes
  - Sync to upstream
  - Provide sync to downstream
  - Correct for asymmetry

Transparent Clocks:
  - Measure residence time
  - Add correction field
  - Don't sync themselves
```

Asymmetry Handling:
```
Problem: Network delays asymmetric

Master → Slave:  10ms
Slave → Master:  2ms

Naive NTP: Assumes symmetric, computes offset wrong

PTP Solution: Measure link delay separately

Delay measurement:
  1. Master sends SYNC at t1
  2. Slave receives at t2
  3. Slave sends DELAY_REQ at t3
  4. Master receives at t4

  Forward delay:  t2 - t1
  Backward delay: t4 - t3

  If asymmetric: Can compute correction factor
```

Boundary Clock Example:
```python
class BoundaryClock:
    def __init__(self):
        self.offset_to_master = 0
        self.local_clock = 0

    def on_sync_message(self, master_time, receive_time):
        """Sync from upstream master"""
        self.offset_to_master = master_time - receive_time
        self.local_clock = receive_time + self.offset_to_master

    def send_sync_to_slaves(self):
        """Sync to downstream slaves"""
        # Send own time (already synced to master)
        send_time = self.local_clock
        self.broadcast_sync(send_time)
```

Transparent Clock:
```python
class TransparentClock:
    def forward_sync_message(self, sync_msg):
        """Forward PTP message with residence time"""
        arrival_time = self.local_clock.now()

        # Measure how long message resided here
        residence_time = arrival_time - sync_msg.arrival_time

        # Add to correction field
        sync_msg.correction += residence_time

        # Forward
        self.send(sync_msg)
```

Production Use:
- Datacenters: 1 μs accuracy achievable
- Financial trading: Low-latency timestamping
- Telecom: 5G network sync
- Industrial: Synchronized automation

Comparison:
```
NTP:
  Accuracy: 1-100ms
  Use case: Internet-wide, best effort

Roughtime:
  Accuracy: 10-100ms
  Use case: Internet-wide, with security

PTP:
  Accuracy: 1-100ns (with hardware support)
  Use case: Datacenter, industrial

TrueTime:
  Accuracy: 1-10ms (with uncertainty bounds)
  Use case: Distributed databases, Google-specific
```

### 6.4 Time in Production Systems (2015-2025)

The evolution from theoretical time models to production-grade time infrastructure represents one of distributed systems' most significant yet underappreciated achievements. This section documents how major tech companies built planet-scale time services—and what they learned from the failures along the way.

#### 6.4.1 Clock Management at Scale

**Facebook's Time Infrastructure (2018-2025)**

The Problem That Triggered Innovation:
```
Facebook Production Incident (2016):
Location: Oregon datacenter
Impact: 2-hour partial outage

Timeline:
  10:00 AM - NTP server misconfiguration deployed
  10:05 AM - Clocks across 5,000 servers diverge
  10:10 AM - Some servers +5 minutes, others -3 minutes
  10:15 AM - Certificate validation failures begin
  10:20 AM - Cascading authentication failures
  10:30 AM - Manual intervention starts
  12:00 PM - Service restored

Root cause analysis:
  - Single NTP server had GPS receiver failure
  - Backup NTP servers misconfigured
  - No automated clock skew detection
  - No emergency fallback mechanism

Cost: $3M+ in revenue, reputation damage
```

Failed Approach 1 - Public NTP (2011-2015):
```
Setup:
  - Each server syncs to pool.ntp.org
  - 4 public NTP servers per server

Problems discovered:
  1. DDoS vulnerability
     - Someone misconfigured DNS to point to Facebook IPs
     - Facebook servers became amplifiers
     - Outbound NTP traffic: 10 Gbps

  2. Accuracy inconsistent
     - Public internet routing
     - Asymmetric paths common
     - Measured accuracy: 5-50ms (unacceptable)

  3. No control
     - Can't fix remote NTP servers
     - Can't prioritize traffic
     - Can't measure reliability

Abandoned after 3 major incidents
```

The Breakthrough - Facebook Time Service (2018):

Architecture:
```
Layer 1: Atomic Reference (Stratum 0)
  - GPS receivers with atomic clocks
  - Located in every datacenter
  - Rubidium oscillators as backup
  - Cost: $50K per datacenter

Layer 2: Time Appliances (Stratum 1)
  - Custom hardware: Open Compute Time Card
  - Direct GPS connection
  - PTP (Precision Time Protocol) support
  - 50-100 appliances per datacenter

Layer 3: Distribution Servers (Stratum 2)
  - 1000s of servers running Chrony
  - Sync from multiple time appliances
  - Serve time to application servers
  - Health checks and failover

Layer 4: Application Servers

**Amazon Time Sync Service (AWS, 2017-present)**

The AWS Challenge:
```
Problem: How do you provide accurate time to millions of customer VMs
across hundreds of datacenters without customer configuration?

Constraints:
  - Customers don't control hardware
  - Virtualization introduces jitter
  - Must work globally
  - Must be reliable (SLA requirement)
  - Must be secure (no spoofing)
```

The Solution - Amazon Time Sync Service:

Architecture:
```
Global Distribution:
  - Atomic clocks in every AWS region
  - Satellite-synchronized references
  - Local NTP servers in every availability zone
  - 169.254.169.123 (link-local IP)

Key Innovation: Link-local IP address
  - Always available from any EC2 instance
  - No DNS required
  - No configuration required
  - Same IP everywhere (but routes locally)
```

Virtualization Time Challenges:
```c
// Problem: VM clock drift during CPU migration

// Guest VM running on CPU 0
time_t t1 = get_time();  // 12:00:00.000

// Hypervisor migrates VM to CPU 1
// (takes 100ms)

time_t t2 = get_time();  // Could be 12:00:00.050 or 12:00:00.150!

// Time went backwards? Forward? Unclear!
```

AWS Solution - Paravirtual Clock:
```c
// KVM PTP (Precision Time Protocol) driver

struct kvm_ptp_clock {
    u64 (*read_time)(void);  // Function pointer
    u32 max_adjust;
    u32 error_bound;
};

// Guest reads time from hypervisor
static u64 kvm_ptp_read_time(struct ptp_clock_info *ptp)
{
    struct kvm_clock_pairing pairing;
    unsigned long flags;
    u64 tsc_timestamp;
    u64 system_time;

    // Hypercall to hypervisor
    if (kvm_clock_get_time(&pairing) != 0)
        return 0;

    // Hypervisor returns:
    // - Host system time
    // - TSC (timestamp counter) value
    // - Scaling factors

    tsc_timestamp = pairing.tsc_timestamp;
    system_time = pairing.system_time;

    // Guest can interpolate time using TSC
    return system_time + ((rdtsc() - tsc_timestamp) * pairing.tsc_to_system_mul);
}

**Cloudflare's Roughtime Deployment (2021-present)**

The Problem with NTP Security:
```
NTP vulnerabilities:
  1. No authentication (most servers)
  2. Amplification attacks
  3. Spoofing possible
  4. Man-in-the-middle easy

Real attack (2019):
  - BGP hijack of NTP server IPs
  - Attacker controlled time for 100K+ clients
  - Used for cryptocurrency attacks
```

#### 6.4.2 Debugging with Time

**Distributed Tracing with Causality**

The Challenge:
```
Production scenario:
  - Request spans 50 microservices
  - Total latency: 500ms
  - Where did time go?

Naive approach: Use timestamps
Problem: Clock skew makes this useless!

Example:
  Service A (clock +5ms):  Request at 12:00:00.005
  Service B (clock -3ms):  Request at 12:00:00.097
  Latency: 92ms?  Or 100ms? Or 108ms?
```

The Solution - Logical Timestamps in Traces:

OpenTelemetry with Causality:

    OperationName   string

    // Physical timestamps (for humans)
    StartTime       time.Time
    EndTime         time.Time

    // Logical timestamps (for causality)
    LogicalStart    uint64  // Lamport clock
    LogicalEnd      uint64

    // Hybrid timestamps (best of both)
    HLCStart        HLC     // Hybrid Logical Clock
    HLCEnd          HLC

    // Causal links
    CausalReferences []SpanID
}

type HLC struct {
    WallTime  int64   // Milliseconds since epoch
    Logical   uint32  // Logical component
}

func (s *Span) PropagateContext(childService string) Context {
    // Increment logical clock
    s.LogicalEnd++

    // Update HLC
    s.HLCEnd = HLC{
        WallTime: time.Now().UnixMilli(),
        Logical:  s.HLCEnd.Logical + 1,
    }

    return Context{
        TraceID:      s.TraceID,
        ParentSpanID: s.SpanID,
        LogicalClock: s.LogicalEnd,
        HLC:          s.HLCEnd,
    }
}

func (s *Span) ReceiveContext(ctx Context) {
    // Update logical clock (Lamport rule)
    s.LogicalStart = max(s.LogicalStart, ctx.LogicalClock) + 1

    // Update HLC (combine physical and logical)
    now := time.Now().UnixMilli()

    if now > ctx.HLC.WallTime {
        // Our clock is ahead: use our time, reset logical
        s.HLCStart = HLC{
            WallTime: now,
            Logical:  0,
        }
    } else if now == ctx.HLC.WallTime {
        // Same physical time: increment logical
        s.HLCStart = HLC{
            WallTime: now,
            Logical:  ctx.HLC.Logical + 1,
        }
    } else {
        // Parent's clock ahead: use their time, increment logical
        s.HLCStart = HLC{
            WallTime: ctx.HLC.WallTime,
            Logical:  ctx.HLC.Logical + 1,
        }
    }
}
```

**Event Ordering Reconstruction**

Production Debugging Scenario (Real case, Uber, 2019):
```
Symptom: Duplicate charges for rides

Investigation:
  1. User requests ride
  2. Payment service charges card
  3. Ride service assigns driver
  4. Network partition occurs
  5. Payment service retries (thinks initial failed)
  6. Card charged twice!

Question: What was actual order of events?

Logs (with timestamps):
  [12:00:00.123] Payment: Charging card ABC
  [12:00:00.089] Ride: Assigning driver XYZ
  [12:00:00.145] Payment: Charge succeeded
  [12:00:00.167] Ride: Driver confirmed

Wait, ride service assigned driver BEFORE payment?
That's backwards! But... clock skew.

## Chapter 7: From Voting to Provability

### 7.1 Traditional Voting (1970s-2000s)

#### 7.1.1 2PC/3PC Analysis

**Two-Phase Commit (2PC) - 1978**

The Classic Distributed Transaction Protocol:

Phase Structure:
```
Phase 1: Voting (PREPARE)
  Coordinator → Participants: PREPARE(txn)
  Participants → Coordinator: YES or NO

Phase 2: Completion (COMMIT/ABORT)
  If all YES: Coordinator → Participants: COMMIT
  If any NO:  Coordinator → Participants: ABORT
```

Protocol Implementation:
```python
class TwoPhaseCoordinator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.participants = []
        self.txn_state = {}  # txn_id → state

    def execute_transaction(self, txn):
        txn_id = generate_txn_id()

        # Phase 1: Prepare
        votes = []
        for participant in self.participants:
            vote = participant.prepare(txn_id, txn.operations)
            votes.append(vote)

            if vote == ABORT:
                # Early abort
                self.abort_transaction(txn_id)
                return ABORTED

        # All participants voted YES
        self.txn_state[txn_id] = PREPARED

        # Write to recovery log
        self.log.write(f"PREPARED {txn_id}")

        # Phase 2: Commit
        try:
            for participant in self.participants:
                participant.commit(txn_id)

            self.txn_state[txn_id] = COMMITTED
            self.log.write(f"COMMITTED {txn_id}")
            return COMMITTED

        except Exception as e:
            # Coordinator crash during commit!
            # Some participants may have committed
            # This is the blocking problem
            raise CoordinatorFailure(e)

class TwoPhaseParticipant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prepared_txns = {}

    def prepare(self, txn_id, operations):
        try:
            # Acquire locks
            self.acquire_locks(operations)

            # Write undo/redo logs
            self.write_logs(txn_id, operations)

            # Persist PREPARED state
            self.log.write(f"PREPARED {txn_id}")
            self.prepared_txns[txn_id] = operations

            return YES
        except Exception:
            return NO

    def commit(self, txn_id):
        operations = self.prepared_txns[txn_id]

        # Apply changes
        self.apply_operations(operations)

        # Write commit record
        self.log.write(f"COMMITTED {txn_id}")

        # Release locks
        self.release_locks(operations)

        del self.prepared_txns[txn_id]
```

**Blocking Scenarios**

Scenario 1: Coordinator crashes after PREPARE
```
Timeline:
  1. Coordinator sends PREPARE to all
  2. All participants vote YES, enter PREPARED state
  3. Coordinator crashes BEFORE sending COMMIT/ABORT

Participant state:
  - Holds locks
  - Cannot decide unilaterally (other participants might have voted NO)
  - Cannot timeout (what if coordinator voted COMMIT before crash?)
  - BLOCKED until coordinator recovers

Impact:
  - Locks held indefinitely
  - Other transactions blocked
  - Deadlock potential
```

Scenario 2: Network partition
```
Coordinator sends COMMIT to subset of participants
Network partition occurs
Remaining participants: stuck in PREPARED

Cannot proceed:
  - Don't know if coordinator decided COMMIT or ABORT
  - Other participants might have committed
  - Must wait for partition to heal

Real-world: Can last hours or days
```

**XA Protocol (X/Open DTP - 1991)**

Standardization of 2PC for heterogeneous systems

Interface:
```c
// XA interface functions
int xa_open(char *xa_info, int rmid, long flags);
int xa_close(char *xa_info, int rmid, long flags);
int xa_start(XID *xid, int rmid, long flags);
int xa_end(XID *xid, int rmid, long flags);
int xa_prepare(XID *xid, int rmid, long flags);
int xa_commit(XID *xid, int rmid, long flags);
int xa_rollback(XID *xid, int rmid, long flags);
int xa_recover(XID *xids, long count, int rmid, long flags);
```

Limitations:
- Still subject to 2PC blocking
- Performance overhead (multiple flushes to disk)
- Heuristic decisions (manual intervention)
- Not widely used in modern systems

**Presume Abort vs Presume Commit**

Optimization: Reduce logging/messages for common case

Presume Abort:
```
Assumption: If coordinator crashes, assume ABORT

Benefits:
  - No ABORT log record needed (most common case)
  - Coordinator can forget txn after abort
  - Participants timeout → abort

Used when: Aborts more common than commits
```

Presume Commit:
```
Assumption: If uncertain, assume COMMIT

Benefits:
  - No COMMIT log record for read-only participants
  - Faster commit path

Risks:
  - Must log ABORT explicitly
  - More dangerous (assumes commit)

Used when: Commits very likely (e.g., prepared transactions)
```

**Recovery Journals**

Coordinator Recovery:
```python
class CoordinatorRecovery:
    def recover(self):
        # Read log from stable storage
        log_entries = self.log.read_all()

        for entry in log_entries:
            if entry.type == PREPARED and not has_outcome(entry.txn_id):
                # Transaction prepared but no outcome logged
                # Must complete with participants

                # Contact participants
                votes = self.contact_participants(entry.txn_id)

                if all(v == YES for v in votes):
                    self.complete_commit(entry.txn_id)
                else:
                    self.complete_abort(entry.txn_id)

            elif entry.type == COMMITTED:
                # Ensure all participants committed
                self.ensure_committed(entry.txn_id)
```

Participant Recovery:
```python
class ParticipantRecovery:
    def recover(self):
        log_entries = self.log.read_all()

        for entry in log_entries:
            if entry.type == PREPARED:
                # Was prepared, but don't know outcome
                # Must contact coordinator

                outcome = self.contact_coordinator(entry.txn_id)

                if outcome == COMMITTED:
                    self.apply_commit(entry.txn_id)
                elif outcome == ABORTED:
                    self.apply_abort(entry.txn_id)
                else:
                    # Coordinator doesn't know either!
                    # Use cooperative termination protocol
                    self.cooperative_termination(entry.txn_id)
```

**Three-Phase Commit (3PC) - 1982**

Attempt to solve 2PC blocking problem

Phase Structure:
```
Phase 1: Can-Commit?
  Coordinator → Participants: CAN-COMMIT?
  Participants → Coordinator: YES/NO

Phase 2: Pre-Commit
  Coordinator → Participants: PRE-COMMIT
  Participants: Enter PRE-COMMITTED state
  (Commit is now inevitable)

Phase 3: Do-Commit
  Coordinator → Participants: DO-COMMIT
  Participants: Actually commit
```

Key Invariant:
```
If any participant is in PRE-COMMITTED state,
no participant can be in ABORTED state.

This allows timeout-based termination!
```

Why 3PC Fails in Practice:
```
1. Requires synchronous network
   - Must distinguish "slow" from "crashed"
   - Real networks are asynchronous

2. Network partition violates assumptions
   Partition Scenario:
     Group A: Received PRE-COMMIT (will commit)
     Group B: Did not receive PRE-COMMIT (will abort on timeout)

     Partition heals → inconsistency!

3. Latency: Additional phase = slower

4. Complexity: More states to manage
```

**Conclusion: 3PC rarely deployed in practice. Modern systems use Paxos Commit or other consensus-based approaches.**

#### 7.1.2 Weighted Voting

**Gifford's Quorum Voting (1979)**

Generalization: Different replicas have different weights

Basic Idea:
```
Each replica has weight W_i
Total weight: W_total = Σ W_i

Read quorum:  R (sum of weights)
Write quorum: W (sum of weights)

Constraint: R + W > W_total
```

**Capacity-Based Weights**

Assign weights based on replica capacity

Example:
```
Replica A: 10 GB storage, weight = 10
Replica B: 5 GB storage, weight = 5
Replica C: 2 GB storage, weight = 2

W_total = 17

Quorum options:
  R=9, W=9   (standard majority)
  R=5, W=13  (optimize for reads)
  R=13, W=5  (optimize for writes)
```

Benefits:
- Utilize heterogeneous hardware
- Proportional to replica capability

Challenges:
- Weight assignment policy
- Reconfiguration complexity

**Geographic Weighting**

Assign weights based on latency/locality

Example:
```
Application in US:
  US-East:  weight = 3
  US-West:  weight = 2
  EU:       weight = 1
  Asia:     weight = 1

W_total = 7
R + W > 7

Config: R=4, W=4
  Can get read quorum from US only (3+2=5 > 4)
  Writes need at least one US + one overseas
```

Trade-offs:
- Lower latency for nearby clients
- Reduced availability (need more replicas)
- Geographic failure correlation

**Dynamic Adjustment**

Adjust weights based on observed behavior

```python
class DynamicWeighting:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weights = {}
        self.performance_history = {}

    def adjust_weights(self):
        for replica_id in self.replicas:
            # Measure recent performance
            avg_latency = self.performance_history[replica_id].avg_latency()
            availability = self.performance_history[replica_id].availability()

            # Compute new weight
            # Higher weight for lower latency, higher availability
            new_weight = (1.0 / avg_latency) * availability

            self.weights[replica_id] = new_weight

    def select_quorum(self, target_weight):
        # Select replicas to meet target weight
        # Prefer high-weight (fast, available) replicas
        sorted_replicas = sorted(
            self.replicas,
            key=lambda r: self.weights[r],
            reverse=True
        )

        quorum = []
        total_weight = 0

        for replica in sorted_replicas:
            quorum.append(replica)
            total_weight += self.weights[replica]

            if total_weight >= target_weight:
                break

        return quorum
```

**Fairness Concerns**

Problem: Weighted voting can be unfair

Scenario:
```
5 replicas, equal weight
Replica A always in read quorum (by client preference)
Replica E rarely selected

Result:
  - Replica A: High load
  - Replica E: Underutilized
  - Imbalanced system
```

Solutions:
- Round-robin quorum selection
- Load-aware quorum selection
- Penalize overloaded replicas (reduce weight temporarily)

#### 7.1.3 Optimizations

**Early Prepare**

Optimization: Prepare before final commit decision

Technique:
```python
class EarlyPrepare:
    def execute_transaction(self, txn):
        # Execute transaction locally
        results = self.execute_locally(txn)

        # Start preparing participants ASAP
        # (before client even sees results)
        self.async_prepare(txn)

        # Return results to client
        return results

    def async_prepare(self, txn):
        # Background: send PREPARE messages
        for participant in txn.participants:
            self.send_prepare_async(participant, txn)
```

Benefits:
- Overlaps computation with network I/O
- Reduces perceived latency
- Client sees results faster

Risks:
- Might prepare unnecessarily (if client aborts)
- More complex failure handling

**Presumed Abort**

Default assumption: Transactions abort unless proven otherwise

Implementation:
```python
class PresumedAbortCoordinator:
    def execute_transaction(self, txn):
        # Phase 1: Prepare
        if not self.prepare_all(txn):
            # Some participant voted NO
            # Don't need to log ABORT
            # Don't need to send ABORT messages
            # Participants timeout → assume abort
            return ABORTED

        # Log PREPARED
        self.log.write(f"PREPARED {txn.id}")

        # Phase 2: Commit
        self.commit_all(txn)

        # Log COMMITTED
        self.log.write(f"COMMITTED {txn.id}")

        return COMMITTED

    def recover(self):
        for txn_id in self.pending_transactions():
            entry = self.log.find(txn_id)

            if entry is None:
                # No log entry → presume aborted
                self.finish_abort(txn_id)
            elif entry.type == PREPARED:
                # Prepared but not committed → abort
                self.finish_abort(txn_id)
            elif entry.type == COMMITTED:
                # Ensure all participants committed
                self.ensure_committed(txn_id)
```

Benefits:
- Fewer log writes (no ABORT record)
- Faster abort path
- Less recovery overhead

Used in: Many databases (Oracle, PostgreSQL internals)

**Read-Only Optimization**

Optimization: Read-only participants don't need Phase 2

Protocol:
```python
class ReadOnlyOptimization:
    def prepare(self, txn_id, operations):
        if self.is_read_only(operations):
            # No updates, no locks held after prepare
            # Don't need to participate in Phase 2

            # Return YES + READ_ONLY flag
            return (YES, READ_ONLY)
        else:
            # Standard prepare
            return self.standard_prepare(txn_id, operations)

class Coordinator:
    def execute_transaction(self, txn):
        # Phase 1
        read_only_participants = []
        update_participants = []

        for p in txn.participants:
            vote, flags = p.prepare(txn.id, txn.ops)

            if READ_ONLY in flags:
                read_only_participants.append(p)
            else:
                update_participants.append(p)

        # Phase 2: Only send to update participants
        for p in update_participants:
            p.commit(txn.id)

        # Read-only participants: already done!
```

Benefits:
- Fewer messages in Phase 2
- Read-only participants release resources sooner
- Scalability for read-heavy workloads

**Coordinator Migration**

Optimization: Transfer coordination to better-placed node

Scenario:
```
Initial:
  Coordinator: US-East
  Participants: US-East, EU, Asia

Transaction mostly accesses EU data

Optimization:
  Migrate coordination to EU node
  Reduce EU latency for remaining operations
```

Protocol:
```python
def migrate_coordinator(txn_id, new_coordinator):
    # Current coordinator sends state to new coordinator
    state = {
        'txn_id': txn_id,
        'participants': participants,
        'operations': operations,
        'phase': current_phase
    }

    new_coordinator.receive_coordination(state)

    # New coordinator takes over
    new_coordinator.continue_transaction(state)
```

Benefits:
- Better latency for multi-region transactions
- Adaptive optimization

Challenges:
- Migration overhead
- Must preserve correctness during migration
- Not commonly implemented (complex)

### 7.2 Byzantine Fault Tolerance (1999-2025)

#### 7.2.1 Classical BFT

**PBFT Protocol (1999)**

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance - Castro & Liskov

Problem: Traditional consensus assumes crash faults
Reality: Need to tolerate arbitrary (malicious) faults

Requirements:
- N ≥ 3f + 1 replicas to tolerate f Byzantine faults
- Replicas can behave maliciously
- Network can delay/reorder messages

**Normal Case Protocol**

Message Flow:
```
Client → Primary: REQUEST
Primary → All: PRE-PREPARE(seq, request)
All → All: PREPARE(seq, request, replica_id)
[Wait for 2f matching PREPARE]
All → All: COMMIT(seq, request, replica_id)
[Wait for 2f+1 matching COMMIT]
All → Client: REPLY(result)
```

Detailed Implementation:
```python
class PBFTReplica:
    def __init__(self, replica_id, f):
        self.replica_id = replica_id
        self.f = f  # max Byzantine faults
        self.n = 3 * f + 1  # total replicas

        self.view = 0
        self.sequence = 0
        self.log = []

        self.pre_prepare_msgs = {}
        self.prepare_msgs = {}
        self.commit_msgs = {}

    def handle_request(self, request):
        """Client request (only primary)"""
        if not self.is_primary():
            return  # Forward to primary

        self.sequence += 1
        seq = self.sequence

        # Create pre-prepare message
        msg = PrePrepare(
            view=self.view,

        )

        # Sign message

        # Broadcast to all replicas
        self.broadcast(msg)

        # Accept and broadcast PREPARE
        prepare_msg = Prepare(
            view=msg.view,

        if key not in self.prepare_msgs:
            self.prepare_msgs[key] = []

        self.prepare_msgs[key].append(msg)

        # Check if we have 2f+1 matching prepares (including pre-prepare)
        if len(self.prepare_msgs[key]) >= 2 * self.f:
            # Prepared!
            self.on_prepared(msg.view, msg.seq, msg.digest)

            seq=seq,
            digest=digest,
            replica_id=self.replica_id
        )
        commit_msg.signature = self.sign(commit_msg)

        self.broadcast(commit_msg)
        self.handle_commit(commit_msg)

    def handle_commit(self, msg):
        """Receive commit from replica"""

        # Verify signature
        if not self.verify_signature(msg, msg.replica_id):
            return

        key = (msg.view, msg.seq, msg.digest)
        if key not in self.commit_msgs:
            self.commit_msgs[key] = []

        self.commit_msgs[key].append(msg)

        # Check if we have 2f+1 matching commits
        if len(self.commit_msgs[key]) >= 2 * self.f + 1:
            # Committed!
            self.on_committed(msg.view, msg.seq, msg.digest)

    def on_committed(self, view, seq, digest):
        """Reached committed state"""

        # Execute request
        request = self.get_request(digest)
        result = self.execute(request)

        # Send reply to client
        reply = Reply(
            view=view,
            seq=seq,
            result=result,
            replica_id=self.replica_id
        )
        reply.signature = self.sign(reply)

        self.send_to_client(reply)
```

Why 3f+1 replicas?
```
Need to distinguish between:
1. Messages from honest replicas
2. Messages from Byzantine replicas

Quorum size for PREPARE: 2f+1
  - At most f Byzantine
  - At least f+1 honest

Quorum size for COMMIT: 2f+1
  - Guarantees intersection with any other quorum
  - At least one honest replica in common

Total: Need f (faulty) + 2f+1 (quorum) = 3f+1
```

**View Changes**

Problem: Primary might be Byzantine

Detection:
- Timeout waiting for pre-prepare
- Conflicting pre-prepares
- Invalid messages from primary

View Change Protocol:
```python
def initiate_view_change(self):
    """Replica suspects primary is faulty"""

    self.view += 1
    new_view = self.view

    # Broadcast VIEW-CHANGE
    msg = ViewChange(
        new_view=new_view,
        last_seq=self.last_executed_seq,
        checkpoint_proof=self.get_checkpoint_proof(),
        prepared_proofs=self.get_prepared_proofs(),
        replica_id=self.replica_id
    )
    msg.signature = self.sign(msg)

    self.broadcast(msg)

def handle_view_change(self, msg):
    """Receive view-change from replica"""

    if msg.new_view < self.view:
        return  # Old view

    # Store view-change message
    self.view_change_msgs[msg.new_view].append(msg)

    # If we're the new primary and have 2f+1 VIEW-CHANGE messages
    if self.is_new_primary(msg.new_view) and \
       len(self.view_change_msgs[msg.new_view]) >= 2 * self.f + 1:

        self.complete_view_change(msg.new_view)

def complete_view_change(self, new_view):
    """New primary completes view change"""

    # Determine correct sequence number
    # Must include all prepared requests
    max_seq = self.determine_max_seq(self.view_change_msgs[new_view])

    # Broadcast NEW-VIEW
    new_view_msg = NewView(
        new_view=new_view,
        view_change_proofs=self.view_change_msgs[new_view],
        pre_prepare_messages=self.construct_pre_prepares(max_seq)
    )
    new_view_msg.signature = self.sign(new_view_msg)

    self.broadcast(new_view_msg)
    self.view = new_view

    # Resume normal operation
```

**Checkpoint Protocol**

Optimization: Garbage collect old messages

Protocol:
```python
class CheckpointProtocol:
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_interval=100):
        self.checkpoint_interval = checkpoint_interval
        self.checkpoints = {}

    def on_execute(self, seq, request):
        """After executing request"""

        result = self.state_machine.execute(request)

        # Check if time to checkpoint
        if seq % self.checkpoint_interval == 0:
            self.create_checkpoint(seq)

        return result

    def create_checkpoint(self, seq):
        """Create checkpoint at sequence number"""

        # Compute state digest
        state_digest = hash(self.state_machine.get_state())

        # Broadcast CHECKPOINT message
        msg = Checkpoint(
            seq=seq,
            state_digest=state_digest,
            replica_id=self.replica_id
        )
        msg.signature = self.sign(msg)

        self.broadcast(msg)

    def handle_checkpoint(self, msg):
        """Receive checkpoint from replica"""

        if not self.verify_signature(msg, msg.replica_id):
            return

        key = (msg.seq, msg.state_digest)
        if key not in self.checkpoints:
            self.checkpoints[key] = []

        self.checkpoints[key].append(msg)

        # If 2f+1 matching checkpoints: stable checkpoint
        if len(self.checkpoints[key]) >= 2 * self.f + 1:
            self.on_stable_checkpoint(msg.seq, msg.state_digest)

    def on_stable_checkpoint(self, seq, state_digest):
        """Checkpoint is stable (certified by 2f+1 replicas)"""

        # Garbage collect messages before this sequence
        self.garbage_collect_before(seq)

        # Update low water mark
        self.low_water_mark = seq
```

**State Transfer**

Problem: Replica falls behind (crashed, slow, or Byzantine)

Protocol:
```python
def request_state_transfer(self):
    """Replica realizes it's behind"""

    # Request state from other replicas
    msg = StateTransferRequest(
        last_seq=self.last_executed_seq,
        replica_id=self.replica_id
    )

    self.broadcast(msg)

def handle_state_transfer_request(self, msg):
    """Receive state transfer request"""

    if msg.last_seq < self.low_water_mark:
        # Replica is far behind, send full state

        response = StateTransferResponse(
            seq=self.last_executed_seq,
            state=self.state_machine.get_state(),
            checkpoint_proof=self.get_stable_checkpoint_proof()
        )

        self.send(msg.replica_id, response)

def handle_state_transfer_response(self, msg):
    """Receive state transfer response"""

    # Verify checkpoint proof (2f+1 signatures)
    if not self.verify_checkpoint_proof(msg.checkpoint_proof):
        return

    # Apply state
    self.state_machine.set_state(msg.state)
    self.last_executed_seq = msg.seq

    # Resume normal operation
```

Performance (1999 hardware):
```
4 replicas (f=1):
  Throughput: ~10,000 ops/sec
  Latency: ~3ms

Overhead vs unreplicated:
  Throughput: 3x slower
  Latency: 2x higher

Reason: Quadratic message complexity O(n²)
```

#### 7.2.2 Modern BFT (2020-2025)

**HotStuff Innovations (2018)**

Key Improvement: Linear message complexity O(n)

Problem with PBFT:
- All-to-all communication in PREPARE phase
- O(n²) messages per request
- Doesn't scale beyond ~10 replicas

HotStuff Solution:
- Leader-based protocol
- Replicas send votes to leader only
- Leader aggregates and broadcasts
- O(n) messages per request

**Protocol Structure**

Three-phase commit:
```
Phase 1: PREPARE
  Leader → All: PREPARE(block)
  All → Leader: VOTE-PREPARE
  Leader: Aggregates into QC (Quorum Certificate)

Phase 2: PRE-COMMIT
  Leader → All: PRE-COMMIT(block, QC_prepare)
  All → Leader: VOTE-PRE-COMMIT
  Leader: Aggregates into QC_pre-commit

Phase 3: COMMIT
  Leader → All: COMMIT(block, QC_pre-commit)
  All → Leader: VOTE-COMMIT
  Leader: Aggregates into QC_commit

Phase 4: DECIDE
  Leader → All: DECIDE(block, QC_commit)
  All: Execute block
```

**Chained HotStuff**

Optimization: Pipeline phases across blocks

Instead of:
```
Block 1: PREPARE → PRE-COMMIT → COMMIT → DECIDE
Block 2: PREPARE → PRE-COMMIT → COMMIT → DECIDE
```

Chained:
```
Block 1: PREPARE
Block 2: PREPARE (= PRE-COMMIT for Block 1)
Block 3: PREPARE (= COMMIT for Block 1)
Block 4: PREPARE (= DECIDE for Block 1)
```

Implementation:
```python
class ChainedHotStuff:
    def __init__(self, replica_id, n, f):
        self.replica_id = replica_id
        self.n = n
        self.f = f

        self.view = 0
        self.chain = []  # Blockchain

    def on_propose(self, block):
        """Leader proposes new block"""

        # Extend chain
        block.parent = self.chain[-1].hash
        block.view = self.view

        # Sign block
        block.signature = self.sign(block)

        # Broadcast
        self.broadcast(NewBlock(block))

    def on_receive_block(self, block):
        """Replica receives block proposal"""

        # Verify block
        if not self.verify_block(block):
            return

        # Vote for block
        vote = Vote(
            block_hash=hash(block),
            view=block.view,
            replica_id=self.replica_id
        )
        vote.signature = self.sign(vote)

        # Send vote to leader
        self.send_to_leader(vote)

        # Update local state
        self.on_vote(block)

    def on_vote(self, block):
        """Process vote (check for commit)"""

        # Check if block's grandparent is committable
        grandparent = self.get_grandparent(block)

        if grandparent and self.has_quorum_certificate(grandparent):
            # Grandparent is committed!
            self.commit(grandparent)

    def commit(self, block):
        """Commit block and execute"""

        # Execute all blocks in chain up to this one
        for b in self.get_uncommitted_ancestors(block):
            self.execute(b)

        self.last_committed = block
```

**Linear View Change**

Key Innovation: View change is O(n) messages, not O(n²)

PBFT view change: O(n²)
- Each replica sends VIEW-CHANGE to all
- New leader collects from all

HotStuff view change: O(n)
- Replicas send VIEW-CHANGE to new leader only
- New leader aggregates and broadcasts

Performance Impact:
```
10 replicas:
  PBFT: 100 messages for view change
  HotStuff: 10 messages for view change

100 replicas:
  PBFT: 10,000 messages
  HotStuff: 100 messages

Enables larger committee sizes!
```

**DiemBFT / LibraBFT (2019)**

Facebook/Meta's BFT for Diem blockchain

Based on HotStuff with modifications:
- Explicit pacemaker for view synchronization
- Reputation-based leader election
- Integration with Move smart contracts

Components:
```python

        self.mempool = DiemMempool()
        self.pacemaker = Pacemaker()
        self.safety_rules = SafetyRules()

class Pacemaker:
    """Manages view progression"""

        self.view += 1
        self.broadcast_timeout_vote()

    def on_quorum_timeout_votes(self):
        """2f+1 replicas timed out"""

        # Move to next view with new leader
        self.trigger_view_change()

class SafetyRules:
    """Ensures replica never violates safety"""

    def verify_proposal(self, block):
        """Check if safe to vote for block"""

        # Never vote for conflicting blocks in same view
        if self.already_voted_this_view(block.view):
            return False

        # Verify block extends safe chain
        if not self.extends_safe_prefix(block):
            return False

        return True
```

Performance (production, 2021):
- Throughput: 10,000+ TPS
- Latency: 500ms - 1s (p50)
- Committee: 100+ validators
- Tested to 1,000+ validators in simulations

**Tendermint / Cosmos (2016)**

BFT consensus for blockchain

Differences from HotStuff:
- Two-phase commit (vs three-phase)
- Explicit locking mechanism
- Immediate finality (no probabilistic finality)

Protocol:
```
Round structure:
  1. PROPOSE: Leader proposes block
  2. PREVOTE: Validators vote on proposal
  3. PRECOMMIT: If 2f+1 prevotes, send precommit
  4. COMMIT: If 2f+1 precommits, commit block

Locking:
  - Once validator precommits, locked on that block
  - Can only unlock if see 2f+1 prevotes for different block
  - Ensures safety across view changes
```

Implementation (simplified):
```go
type Tendermint struct {
    height int
    round int
    step Step  // PROPOSE, PREVOTE, PRECOMMIT, COMMIT

    lockedBlock *Block
    lockedRound int

    validBlock *Block
    validRound int
}

func (t *Tendermint) OnProposal(block *Block) {
    if t.step != PROPOSE {
        return
    }

    // Verify block
    if !t.verifyBlock(block) {
        return
    }

    // Check if locked on different block
    if t.lockedBlock != nil && t.lockedRound < t.round {
        // Locked, but this is newer round
        // Can only prevote if proposal extends locked block
        if block.extends(t.lockedBlock) {
            t.broadcast(Prevote{block: block})
        } else {
            t.broadcast(Prevote{block: nil})  // nil vote
        }
    } else {
        // Not locked, vote for proposal
        t.broadcast(Prevote{block: block})
    }

    t.step = PREVOTE
}

func (t *Tendermint) OnQuorumPrevotes(block *Block) {
    if t.step != PREVOTE {
        return
    }

    // Received 2f+1 prevotes for this block
    t.validBlock = block
    t.validRound = t.round

    // Broadcast precommit
    t.broadcast(Precommit{block: block})

    // Lock on this block
    t.lockedBlock = block
    t.lockedRound = t.round

    t.step = PRECOMMIT
}

func (t *Tendermint) OnQuorumPrecommits(block *Block) {
    if t.step != PRECOMMIT {
        return
    }

    // Received 2f+1 precommits
    // Block is committed!
    t.commit(block)

    // Move to next height
    t.height++
    t.round = 0
    t.lockedBlock = nil
    t.lockedRound = -1
    t.step = PROPOSE
}
```

- Throughput: ~10,000 TPS (with app bottleneck removed)
- Latency: ~7 seconds (p50)
- Validators: 175 active
- Limitation: All validators participate in every block (doesn't scale to 1000s)

#### 7.2.3 DAG-Based BFT

**Narwhal Mempool (2021)**

Innovation: Decouple data dissemination from consensus

Traditional BFT:
```
Consensus + Data Dissemination intertwined
Leader proposes block → Broadcast block → Vote

Problem: Large blocks slow down consensus
```

Narwhal Design:
```
Narwhal: Data dissemination (mempool)
  - DAG of certificates
  - High throughput, asynchronous

Bullshark/Tusk: Consensus (ordering)
  - Orders Narwhal certificates
  - Fast, low latency
```

**Narwhal Architecture**

DAG Structure:
```python
class NarwhalCertificate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.author = None  # Validator who created this
        self.round = 0
        self.parents = []  # Certificates from previous round
        self.transactions = []  # Batch of transactions
        self.signatures = []  # 2f+1 signatures

class NarwhalWorker:
    def __init__(self, validator_id):
        self.validator_id = validator_id
        self.transaction_buffer = []
        self.dag = DAG()

    def create_certificate(self, round):
        """Create certificate for current round"""

        # Get parent certificates (from previous round)
        parents = self.dag.get_round(round - 1)

        # Create certificate
        cert = NarwhalCertificate(
            author=self.validator_id,
            round=round,
            parents=parents,
            transactions=self.transaction_buffer[:BATCH_SIZE]
        )

        # Broadcast for signatures
        self.broadcast_for_signatures(cert)

    def on_receive_certificate_proposal(self, cert):
        """Receive certificate proposal from peer"""

        # Verify certificate
        if not self.verify_certificate(cert):
            return

        # Sign certificate
        signature = self.sign(cert)

        # Send signature back
        self.send_signature(cert.author, signature)

    def on_receive_signatures(self, cert, signatures):
        """Received 2f+1 signatures for our certificate"""

        if len(signatures) < 2 * self.f + 1:
            return

        # Certificate is certified!
        cert.signatures = signatures

        # Add to DAG
        self.dag.add_certificate(cert)

        # Broadcast certified certificate
        self.broadcast_certificate(cert)
```

Properties:
- Asynchronous: No waiting for leader
- High throughput: All validators produce certificates in parallel
- Causal order: DAG structure preserves dependencies

**Bullshark Ordering (2022)**

Consensus layer on top of Narwhal

Task: Decide total order over certificates in DAG

Key Idea: Elect leader certificates, commit their causal history

Protocol:
```python
class Bullshark:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dag = None  # Reference to Narwhal DAG
        self.committed_round = 0

    def run_consensus(self):
        """Periodically order certificates"""

        while True:
            round = self.committed_round + 2

            # Wait for round to be available in DAG
            self.wait_for_round(round)

            # Elect leader for this round
            leader = self.elect_leader(round)

            # Check if leader certificate is supported by 2f+1
            if self.has_support(leader):
                # Commit leader and its causal history
                self.commit_certificate(leader)

            # Move to next round
            self.committed_round = round

    def has_support(self, cert):
        """Check if certificate has 2f+1 support"""

        next_round_certs = self.dag.get_round(cert.round + 1)

        # Count how many certificates in next round reference this one
        supporters = []
        for c in next_round_certs:
            if cert in self.get_causal_history(c):
                supporters.append(c)

        return len(supporters) >= 2 * self.f + 1

    def commit_certificate(self, cert):
        """Commit certificate and its causal history"""

        # Topologically sort causal history
        history = self.get_causal_history(cert)
        ordered = self.topological_sort(history)

        # Execute transactions in order
        for c in ordered:
            if c.round <= self.committed_round:
                continue  # Already committed

            for txn in c.transactions:
                self.execute(txn)

        self.committed_round = cert.round
```

**Tusk Consensus (2020)**

Alternative to Bullshark, slightly different leader election

Key Difference:
- Bullshark: Leaders elected deterministically every 2 rounds
- Tusk: Random leader election via common coin

Trade-offs:
```
Bullshark:
  + Simpler
  + More predictable
  - Slightly higher latency (2 round delay)

Tusk:
  + Lower latency (can commit every round)
  - More complex (random beacon)
```

**Throughput Analysis**

Narwhal+Bullshark Performance (100 validators):
```
Per-validator:
  Certificate size: 500 KB (batched transactions)
  Certificate rate: 1 per 1-2 seconds

Total throughput:
  100 validators × 500 KB/s = 50 MB/s = 400 Mbps

In transactions:
  Assume 500 bytes/txn average
  = 100,000 TPS

Consensus latency:
  2-4 seconds (depending on network)

Comparison:
  HotStuff: ~10,000 TPS (bottlenecked by leader)
  Narwhal+Bullshark: 100,000+ TPS (parallel)
```

Real-world Deployment (Sui blockchain, 2023):
```
Testnet results:
  - 100 validators
  - 130,000 TPS sustained
  - 3-second latency (p50)
  - 15-second latency (p99)

Mainnet (2024):
  - 50-100 validators
  - 50,000+ TPS observed
  - Sub-second latency for simple transactions
```

**Latency Trade-offs**

Traditional BFT (HotStuff):
```
1 round: Propose
1 round: Vote
1 round: Commit
= 3 network round trips
= ~300ms (WAN)
```

DAG-based BFT (Narwhal+Bullshark):
```
Narwhal: Continuous (asynchronous)
  - Certificates produced in parallel
  - 1-2 second buffering for batching

Bullshark: Every 2 rounds
  - 2 rounds = 2-4 seconds

Total: 3-5 seconds typical

Trade-off: Higher latency, but much higher throughput
```

Use Cases:
```
HotStuff/Tendermint:
  - Financial transactions (low latency critical)
  - Small-medium validator sets (< 100)
  - Leader-based is acceptable

Narwhal+Bullshark/Tusk:
  - High-throughput applications (gaming, social)
  - Large validator sets (100-1000)
  - Latency less critical than throughput
```

**Committee Size vs Throughput/Security**

Security Analysis:
```
Byzantine fault tolerance requires:
  n ≥ 3f + 1

For different security assumptions:

50% Byzantine tolerance:
  f = n/3
  n = 3f + 1 → f ≈ n/3
  Example: 100 nodes, tolerate 33 Byzantine

33% Byzantine tolerance:
  Requires different assumptions (synchrony)
  n = 2f + 1
  Example: 100 nodes, tolerate 49 Byzantine (with sync)
```

Throughput vs Committee Size:
```
Traditional BFT (leader-based):
  Throughput: Limited by leader bandwidth
  Scale: O(1) - doesn't grow with committee size

DAG-based BFT:
  Throughput: Sum of all validator bandwidth
  Scale: O(n) - linear with committee size!

Example (10 Gbps per validator):
  10 validators: 100 Gbps aggregate
  100 validators: 1 Tbps aggregate
  1000 validators: 10 Tbps aggregate (theoretical)
```

Security vs Throughput Trade-off:
```
More validators:
  + Higher security (more decentralization)
  + Higher throughput (DAG-based)
  - Higher latency (more coordination)
  - Higher bandwidth requirements

Sweet spot (2025):
  - 50-150 validators for most applications
  - 1000+ validators for maximum decentralization (research)
```

### 7.3 Proof Systems (2010-2025)

#### 7.3.1 Commit Certificates

**Structure and Validation**

Commit Certificate: Proof that a value was agreed upon

Basic Structure:
```python
class CommitCertificate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None  # Committed value
        self.signatures = []  # List of (replica_id, signature)
        self.view = 0  # View number (for BFT)
        self.sequence = 0  # Sequence number

    def is_valid(self, public_keys, f):
        """Verify certificate is valid"""

        # Need 2f+1 signatures for BFT
        # Need f+1 signatures for crash fault tolerance

        if len(self.signatures) < 2 * f + 1:
            return False

        # Verify each signature
        message = self.get_signed_message()

        for replica_id, signature in self.signatures:
            public_key = public_keys[replica_id]

            if not verify_signature(message, signature, public_key):
                return False

        return True

    def get_signed_message(self):
        """Get message that was signed"""
        return f"{self.view}:{self.sequence}:{hash(self.value)}"
```

Usage in Consensus:
```python
class ConsensusWithCertificates:
    def commit(self, value):
        """Commit value and generate certificate"""

        # Phase 1: Propose
        proposal = Proposal(value=value, seq=self.seq)
        votes = self.broadcast_and_collect_votes(proposal)

        # Phase 2: If quorum, create certificate
        if len(votes) >= 2 * self.f + 1:
            cert = CommitCertificate(
                value=value,
                signatures=votes,
                view=self.view,
                sequence=self.seq
            )

            # Broadcast certificate
            self.broadcast(cert)

            return cert

        return None

    def verify_commit(self, cert):
        """Verify that value was committed"""

        # Don't need to re-run consensus!
        # Just verify certificate
        return cert.is_valid(self.public_keys, self.f)
```

**Aggregated Signatures (BLS)**

Problem: Large committees → large certificates

Example:
```
100 validators, each signature 64 bytes
= 6,400 bytes per certificate
= Expensive to store/transmit
```

BLS Signature Aggregation:
```python
class BLSAggregatedCertificate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None
        self.aggregated_signature = None  # Single signature!
        self.signer_bitmap = None  # Bit vector of who signed
        self.view = 0
        self.sequence = 0

    @staticmethod
    def aggregate_signatures(signatures):
        """Combine multiple BLS signatures into one"""

        # BLS property: Signatures can be added
        agg_sig = BLS_ZERO

        for sig in signatures:
            agg_sig = bls_add(agg_sig, sig)

        return agg_sig

    def is_valid(self, public_keys, f):
        """Verify aggregated signature"""

        # Check we have enough signers
        num_signers = popcount(self.signer_bitmap)

        if num_signers < 2 * f + 1:
            return False

        # Aggregate public keys of signers
        agg_pubkey = BLS_ZERO

        for i, bit in enumerate(self.signer_bitmap):
            if bit:
                agg_pubkey = bls_add(agg_pubkey, public_keys[i])

        # Verify aggregated signature
        message = self.get_signed_message()

        return bls_verify(message, self.aggregated_signature, agg_pubkey)
```

Size Comparison:
```
Traditional certificate (100 validators):
  Signatures: 100 × 64 bytes = 6,400 bytes
  Replica IDs: 100 × 8 bytes = 800 bytes
  Total: ~7,200 bytes

BLS aggregated certificate:
  Aggregated signature: 96 bytes
  Signer bitmap: 100 bits = 13 bytes
  Total: ~109 bytes

Compression: 66x smaller!
```

Performance:
```
BLS signature generation: ~1ms
BLS signature verification: ~2ms
BLS aggregation: ~0.01ms per signature

Trade-off: Slower than ECDSA, but aggregation enables scaling
```

**Certificate Chains**

Application: Blockchain / Sequential consensus

Structure:
```python
class BlockCertificate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.block_hash = None
        self.parent_hash = None  # Previous block
        self.height = 0
        self.aggregated_signature = None
        self.signer_bitmap = None

class CertificateChain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.certificates = {}  # block_hash → certificate
        self.head = None

    def extend_chain(self, block, cert):
        """Add new block with certificate"""

        # Verify certificate
        if not cert.is_valid(self.public_keys, self.f):
            return False

        # Verify chain continuity
        if block.parent_hash != self.head.block_hash:
            return False

        # Add to chain
        self.certificates[block.hash] = cert
        self.head = cert

        return True

    def verify_chain(self, start, end):
        """Verify certificate chain from start to end"""

        current = end

        while current.hash != start.hash:
            # Verify certificate
            if not self.certificates[current.hash].is_valid(...):
                return False

            # Move to parent
            current = self.get_block(current.parent_hash)

        return True
```

**Light Client Support**

Problem: Full nodes expensive, want lightweight verification

Light Client: Verifies only certificates, not full blocks

```python
class LightClient:
    def __init__(self, validator_public_keys):
        self.validator_keys = validator_public_keys
        self.trusted_certificates = {}  # Sparse set of trusted certs

    def verify_transaction(self, txn, block_hash, proof):
        """Verify transaction was included without full block"""

        # 1. Get certificate for block
        cert = self.get_certificate(block_hash)

        # 2. Verify certificate (2f+1 signatures)
        if not cert.is_valid(self.validator_keys, self.f):
            return False

        # 3. Verify Merkle proof (see 7.3.2)
        if not self.verify_merkle_proof(txn, block_hash, proof):
            return False

        return True

    def sync_to_latest(self, full_node):
        """Sync to latest block without downloading full chain"""

        # Get latest certificate
        latest_cert = full_node.get_latest_certificate()

        # Verify certificate
        if not latest_cert.is_valid(self.validator_keys, self.f):
            return False

        # Trust this certificate
        self.trusted_certificates[latest_cert.block_hash] = latest_cert

        # Can now verify transactions in this block
```

Benefits:
- Low storage: Only certificates, not full blocks
- Low bandwidth: Download only proofs for relevant transactions
- Still secure: Inherits security from validator signatures

Used in:
- Ethereum light clients
- Cosmos IBC light clients
- Polkadot light clients

#### 7.3.2 Merkle-Based Proofs

**Inclusion Proofs**

Prove transaction is in a block without revealing entire block

Merkle Tree Structure:
```python
class MerkleTree:
    def __init__(self, leaves):
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.tree = self.build_tree(leaves)

    def build_tree(self, leaves):
        """Build Merkle tree from leaves"""

        if len(leaves) == 0:
            return None

        # Current level
        level = [hash(leaf) for leaf in leaves]

        tree = [level]

        # Build up to root
        while len(level) > 1:
            next_level = []

            for i in range(0, len(level), 2):
                left = level[i]
                right = level[i+1] if i+1 < len(level) else left

                parent = hash(left + right)
                next_level.append(parent)

            tree.append(next_level)
            level = next_level

        return tree

    def get_root(self):
        """Get Merkle root"""
        return self.tree[-1][0]

    def get_proof(self, index):
        """Generate inclusion proof for leaf at index"""

        proof = []
        current_index = index

        for level_idx in range(len(self.tree) - 1):
            level = self.tree[level_idx]

            # Get sibling
            if current_index % 2 == 0:
                # Left child, sibling is right
                sibling_index = current_index + 1
                position = "right"
            else:
                # Right child, sibling is left
                sibling_index = current_index - 1
                position = "left"

            if sibling_index < len(level):
                sibling = level[sibling_index]
            else:
                sibling = level[current_index]  # Duplicate if odd

            proof.append((sibling, position))

            # Move to parent
            current_index = current_index // 2

        return proof

    @staticmethod
    def verify_proof(leaf, proof, root):
        """Verify inclusion proof"""

        current_hash = hash(leaf)

        for sibling, position in proof:
            if position == "left":
                current_hash = hash(sibling + current_hash)
            else:
                current_hash = hash(current_hash + sibling)

        return current_hash == root
```

Example Usage:
```python
# Block with 1000 transactions
transactions = [f"tx_{i}" for i in range(1000)]

# Build Merkle tree
tree = MerkleTree(transactions)
root = tree.get_root()

# Include root in block header (32 bytes)
block_header = BlockHeader(merkle_root=root, ...)

# Light client downloads only block header

# Later: Prove transaction 500 is included
tx_500 = transactions[500]
proof = tree.get_proof(500)

# Proof size: log2(1000) ≈ 10 hashes = 320 bytes
# vs full block: 1000 transactions = ~500 KB

# Verify
assert MerkleTree.verify_proof(tx_500, proof, root)
```

**Exclusion Proofs (Sparse Merkle Trees)**

Problem: Prove a key is NOT in the tree

Sparse Merkle Tree:
- Every possible key has a position in tree
- Most positions are empty (default value)
- Tree is "sparse"

```python
class SparseMerkleTree:
    def __init__(self, height=256):
        self.height = height  # e.g., 256 for SHA-256
        self.root = EMPTY_HASH
        self.nodes = {}  # path → hash

    def update(self, key, value):
        """Update key-value pair"""

        # Compute path from key (e.g., hash of key)
        path = hash_to_bits(key, self.height)

        # Update leaf
        leaf_hash = hash(key + value) if value else EMPTY_HASH

        # Update tree bottom-up
        current_hash = leaf_hash

        for i in range(self.height - 1, -1, -1):
            bit = path[i]

            # Get sibling
            sibling_path = path[:i] + (1 - bit,)
            sibling_hash = self.nodes.get(sibling_path, EMPTY_HASH)

            # Compute parent
            if bit == 0:
                parent_hash = hash(current_hash + sibling_hash)
            else:
                parent_hash = hash(sibling_hash + current_hash)

            # Store
            parent_path = path[:i]
            self.nodes[parent_path] = parent_hash

            current_hash = parent_hash

        self.root = current_hash

    def prove_inclusion(self, key):
        """Prove key is in tree (value ≠ empty)"""

        path = hash_to_bits(key, self.height)
        proof = []

        for i in range(self.height):
            bit = path[i]
            sibling_path = path[:i] + (1 - bit,)
            sibling_hash = self.nodes.get(sibling_path, EMPTY_HASH)

            proof.append(sibling_hash)

        return proof

    def prove_exclusion(self, key):
        """Prove key is NOT in tree"""

        # Same as inclusion proof!
        # Difference: Verification shows leaf is empty

        return self.prove_inclusion(key)

    @staticmethod
    def verify_exclusion(key, proof, root):
        """Verify key is NOT in tree"""

        path = hash_to_bits(key, len(proof))
        current_hash = EMPTY_HASH  # Expecting empty leaf

        for i in range(len(proof) - 1, -1, -1):
            bit = path[i]
            sibling = proof[i]

            if bit == 0:
                current_hash = hash(current_hash + sibling)
            else:
                current_hash = hash(sibling + current_hash)

        # If root matches, key is provably not in tree!
        return current_hash == root
```

Applications:
- Proof of account non-existence (blockchain)
- Revocation proofs (key not in revoked set)
- Transparency logs (Certificate Transparency)

**State Commitments**

Commit to entire state with single hash

```python
class StateCommitment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}  # key → value
        self.merkle_tree = SparseMerkleTree()

    def apply_transaction(self, txn):
        """Apply transaction and update commitment"""

        for key, value in txn.writes:
            self.state[key] = value
            self.merkle_tree.update(key, value)

    def get_commitment(self):
        """Get state commitment (root hash)"""
        return self.merkle_tree.root

    def prove_state(self, key):
        """Prove current value of key"""

        value = self.state.get(key)
        proof = self.merkle_tree.prove_inclusion(key)

        return StateProof(
            key=key,
            value=value,
            proof=proof,
            commitment=self.get_commitment()
        )

    @staticmethod
    def verify_state_proof(proof):
        """Verify state proof"""

        # Verify Merkle proof
        return SparseMerkleTree.verify_inclusion(
            proof.key,
            proof.value,
            proof.proof,
            proof.commitment
        )
```

**Witness Compression**

Problem: Proofs can be large for deep trees

Technique 1: Proof aggregation
```
Multiple proofs for same block:
  - Share common ancestors
  - Send each hash only once
  - Client reconstructs individual proofs
```

Technique 2: Verkle Trees (2021)
```
Instead of binary Merkle tree:
  - Use wide tree (256-ary or more)
  - Use vector commitments (KZG or IPA)

  - Proof size: O(log_256(n)) vs O(log_2(n))
  - Example: 1B leaves
    - Merkle: log_2(1B) = 30 hashes = 960 bytes
    - Verkle: log_256(1B) = 3.75 hashes ≈ 150 bytes

Trade-off: More expensive to compute
```

**Data Availability Sampling (DAS)**

Problem: Light clients can't verify block data is available

Traditional: Download entire block (expensive)

DAS Solution: Sample random chunks, reconstruct if needed

Protocol:
```python
class DataAvailabilitySampling:
    def __init__(self, block_size, num_samples=10):
        self.block_size = block_size
        self.num_samples = num_samples

    def prepare_block(self, block_data):
        """Prepare block with erasure coding"""

        # Apply Reed-Solomon erasure coding
        # k data chunks + m parity chunks
        # Can reconstruct from any k chunks

        chunks = self.split_into_chunks(block_data)
        encoded = self.reed_solomon_encode(chunks)

        # Compute Merkle root of all chunks
        merkle_tree = MerkleTree(encoded)

        return BlockHeader(
            data_root=merkle_tree.get_root(),
            num_chunks=len(encoded)
        ), encoded

    def sample_availability(self, block_header, network):
        """Light client samples to verify availability"""

        # Randomly sample chunks
        sampled_chunks = []

        for _ in range(self.num_samples):
            # Pick random chunk index
            chunk_idx = random.randint(0, block_header.num_chunks - 1)

            # Request chunk + Merkle proof from network
            chunk, proof = network.get_chunk(block_header.hash, chunk_idx)

            # Verify Merkle proof
            if not MerkleTree.verify_proof(chunk, proof, block_header.data_root):
                return False  # Invalid chunk

            sampled_chunks.append((chunk_idx, chunk))

        # Probabilistic guarantee:
        # If >= 50% of chunks available, we'll detect with high probability

        return True  # Likely available
```

**Erasure Coding for Light Clients**

Reed-Solomon Encoding:
```python
class ReedSolomonDAS:
    def __init__(self, k, m):
        self.k = k  # Number of data chunks
        self.m = m  # Number of parity chunks
        self.n = k + m  # Total chunks

    def encode(self, data):
        """Encode data into n chunks"""

        # Split data into k chunks
        chunk_size = len(data) // self.k
        data_chunks = [data[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(data), chunk_size)]

        # Generate m parity chunks using Reed-Solomon
        # Property: Can reconstruct from any k out of n chunks

        parity_chunks = self.generate_parity(data_chunks)

        return data_chunks + parity_chunks

    def reconstruct(self, received_chunks, indices):
        """Reconstruct data from any k chunks"""

        if len(received_chunks) < self.k:
            return None  # Not enough chunks

        # Use Reed-Solomon decoding
        data_chunks = self.reed_solomon_decode(received_chunks, indices)

        # Concatenate data chunks
        return b''.join(data_chunks)
```

Properties:
```
k=50, m=50 (100 total chunks):
  - Need any 50 chunks to reconstruct
  - 50% redundancy

  - Availability threshold: 50%
  - If >= 50 chunks available, block is reconstructable

  - Light client sampling:
    - Sample 10 random chunks
    - If < 50% available: ~0% chance all 10 succeed
    - If >= 50% available: ~99.9% chance all 10 succeed

  - High confidence with few samples!
```

- Ethereum DAS proposals (EIP-4844+)
- Celestia (modular blockchain)
- Polygon Avail

**KZG Commitments (2010)**

Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg Polynomial Commitments

Use Case: Commit to polynomial, prove evaluations

Why Useful:
- Constant-size proofs (48 bytes)
- Efficient verification
- Enables succinct proofs

```python
class KZGCommitment:
    def __init__(self, trusted_setup):
        self.setup = trusted_setup  # Powers of tau ceremony

    def commit(self, polynomial):
        """Commit to polynomial"""

        # Polynomial: p(x) = a_0 + a_1*x + a_2*x^2 + ...

        # Commitment: C = a_0*G + a_1*τG + a_2*τ^2*G + ...
        # where τ is secret from trusted setup

        commitment = G_ZERO

        for i, coeff in enumerate(polynomial.coefficients):
            commitment = commitment + coeff * self.setup.powers_of_tau[i]

        return commitment

    def prove_evaluation(self, polynomial, point):
        """Prove p(point) = value"""

        value = polynomial.evaluate(point)

        # Compute quotient polynomial: q(x) = (p(x) - value) / (x - point)
        quotient = polynomial.divide_by_linear(point, value)

        # Proof: π = commitment to quotient
        proof = self.commit(quotient)

        return EvaluationProof(
            point=point,
            value=value,
            proof=proof
        )

    def verify_evaluation(self, commitment, proof):
        """Verify evaluation proof"""

        # Use pairing check:
        # e(C - value*G, G) = e(π, τ*G - point*G)

        # This checks that quotient is correct
        # Without revealing polynomial!

        lhs = pairing(commitment - proof.value * G1_GENERATOR, G2_GENERATOR)
        rhs = pairing(proof.proof, self.setup.tau_g2 - proof.point * G2_GENERATOR)

        return lhs == rhs
```

**Trusted Setup Problem**

KZG requires trusted setup:
- Generate random τ (tau)
- Compute powers: τ, τ^2, τ^3, ..., τ^n
- MUST destroy τ (if leaked, can create fake proofs)

Ceremony (Powers of Tau):
```
Multi-party computation:
  Participant 1: Generates τ_1, computes powers, destroys τ_1
  Participant 2: Multiplies by τ_2, destroys τ_2
  ...
  Participant 1000: Multiplies by τ_1000, destroys τ_1000

Final: τ = τ_1 * τ_2 * ... * τ_1000

Security: Only need ONE honest participant
  (who actually destroyed their secret)
```

Real ceremonies:
- Zcash (2016): 6 participants
- Ethereum (2022): 140,000+ participants
- Ensures high confidence in security

**IPA Commitments (Alternative)**

Inner Product Argument - No trusted setup!

```python
class IPACommitment:
    def __init__(self, generators):
        self.generators = generators  # Public, no trusted setup needed

    def commit(self, vector):
        """Commit to vector"""

        # Commitment: C = v_1*G_1 + v_2*G_2 + ... + v_n*G_n

        commitment = G_ZERO

        for i, value in enumerate(vector):
            commitment = commitment + value * self.generators[i]

        return commitment

    def prove_evaluation(self, vector, index):
        """Prove vector[index] = value"""

        # IPA protocol: Logarithmic-size proof
        # Proof size: O(log n) vs O(1) for KZG

        # ... (complex protocol omitted)

        return proof
```

Trade-offs:
```
KZG:
  + Constant proof size (48 bytes)
  + Fast verification (2 pairings)
  - Requires trusted setup
  - Specific to BLS12-381 curve

IPA:
  + No trusted setup
  + Works on any elliptic curve
  - Logarithmic proof size (log n * 32 bytes)
  - Slower verification (O(log n))
```

Choice:
- Ethereum: KZG (already has trusted setup culture from Zcash)
- Mina: IPA (prioritize no trusted setup)
- StarkNet: FRI (different approach, no trusted setup)

**Evolution: Simple to Aggregated Signatures**

Timeline:
```
1970s: RSA signatures
  - Simple
  - ~2048 bits each
  - Cannot aggregate

2000s: ECDSA (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
  - Smaller (256 bits)
  - Still cannot aggregate

2010s: BLS signatures
  - 384-512 bits
  - CAN aggregate!
  - Enables efficient multi-signatures

2020s: BLS + KZG commitments
  - Aggregated signatures (O(1))
  - Succinct proofs (O(1))
  - Light clients practical
```

Modern Stack (Ethereum 2025):
```
Consensus: BLS signatures (aggregated)
  - 100 validators → 1 signature (96 bytes)

Data Availability: KZG commitments
  - Block → 48 byte commitment
  - Proof of chunk: 48 bytes

Result:
  Light client can verify:
  - Consensus: 96 bytes
  - Data availability: 96 bytes (commitment + proof)
  - Total: 192 bytes to verify entire block!

vs 2015 (no aggregation):
  - 100 signatures: 6,400 bytes
  - Full block download: Megabytes
  - Infeasible for light clients
```

**Performance Limits (2025)**

Cryptographic Operations:
```
BLS signature generation: 1-2ms
BLS signature verification: 2-3ms
BLS aggregation: 0.01ms per signature

KZG commitment: 10-50ms (for polynomial of degree 4096)
KZG proof generation: 10-50ms
KZG proof verification: 2-5ms (2 pairings)

Merkle proof generation: 0.1-1ms
Merkle proof verification: 0.1-1ms

ZK-SNARK proof generation: 100ms - 10s (depending on circuit)
ZK-SNARK proof verification: 1-10ms
```

Bottlenecks:
```
1. Proof generation (prover time)
   - KZG: Milliseconds
   - ZK-SNARKs: Seconds to minutes

2. Trusted setups
   - Need ceremonies
   - One-time cost, but complex

3. Hardware requirements
   - ZK proving: High CPU/memory
   - Not feasible on mobile/IoT

4. State growth
   - Even with succinct proofs, state grows
   - Need state expiry or rent
```

Future Directions:
- Hardware acceleration (FPGAs, ASICs)
- Recursive proofs (Halo 2, Nova)
- Incrementally verifiable computation
- Practical for IoT devices?
