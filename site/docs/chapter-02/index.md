# Chapter 2: Time, Order, and Causality

## Introduction: When Clocks Lie

"What time is it?"

In a single computer, this question has a simple answer: read the system clock. But in a distributed system spanning continents, this innocent question reveals a fundamental impossibility: **there is no global "now."**

Two events occur. One in Tokyo, one in London. Which happened first? You might think: "Compare their timestamps." But what if Tokyo's clock is 100 milliseconds ahead of London's? What if a network message took 80 milliseconds to travel? What if the clocks are drifting apart at different rates? What if someone adjusts a clock backward using NTP, and "now" becomes earlier than "before"?

In distributed systems, time is not what you think it is. And yet, we desperately need to order events. We need to know which database write happened first. We need to detect whether a message is a reply to another message. We need to decide whether a cache entry is fresh or stale. We need to prove that a transaction commit happened before a read.

**This chapter is about solving the unsolvable: imposing order on events when time itself is unreliable.**

### The Central Problem

Consider a simple scenario: Alice and Bob are editing a shared document.

- Alice's computer (in New York): Deletes paragraph 3 at timestamp `2025-10-01T12:00:00.150Z`
- Bob's computer (in London): Edits paragraph 3 at timestamp `2025-10-01T12:00:00.100Z`

Which operation happened first? The timestamps say Bob's edit (100ms) came before Alice's delete (150ms). But what if:

- Alice's clock is 200ms slow? Then her delete actually happened at 350ms, after Bob's edit.
- Bob's clock is 100ms fast? Then his edit actually happened at 0ms, well before Alice's delete.
- The network took 80ms to deliver Alice's operation? We need to account for propagation delay.

**You cannot trust timestamps from different machines to tell you temporal order.** Yet ordering is fundamental to correctness. If we apply Bob's edit after Alice's delete, we're editing a paragraph that no longer exists. Undefined behavior. Data corruption. Lost work.

This is the central tension of Chapter 2: **ordering matters more than time, yet all we have are unreliable clocks.**

### Why This Matters

Time and ordering problems aren't academic curiosities—they cause real production failures:

**The Cloudflare Leap Second Incident (2017)**: On New Year's Day, Cloudflare's DNS infrastructure went down globally for 90 minutes. The cause? A leap second caused time to go backward (23:59:59 → 23:59:60 → 00:00:00), violating the assumption that time is monotonic. Systems that computed time intervals got negative durations and crashed. Cost: millions in lost traffic, damaged reputation, SLA breaches.

**The Cassandra Clock Skew Data Loss**: Facebook's Cassandra cluster experienced clock skew between nodes (one clock 10 seconds ahead). During repairs, the anti-entropy mechanism used timestamps to resolve conflicts. The node with the fast clock "won" all conflicts, even though its data was actually older. Correct writes were overwritten by stale data. Detection took days. Recovery required manual intervention across thousands of nodes.

**The Google Spanner Anomaly (Internal)**: Before TrueTime, Google's Spanner encountered a subtle bug: a read at timestamp T returned data from T+5ms because clock uncertainty wasn't accounted for. This violated external consistency (a consistency level stronger than linearizability). The solution became TrueTime: make uncertainty explicit, wait it out before committing.

These failures share a common pattern: **systems assumed time was reliable, monotonic, and synchronized. It wasn't.** The failures were inevitable.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

1. **Physical Time**: How NTP, PTP, and clock hardware actually work, their accuracy limits, and when they fail
2. **Logical Time**: Lamport clocks and vector clocks that provide ordering without physical clocks
3. **Hybrid Approaches**: Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) and TrueTime that combine physical and logical time
4. **Causality**: What it means, why it matters, and how to preserve it
5. **Production Patterns**: How to design time systems that degrade predictably when clocks fail

More importantly, you'll internalize the **evidence-based mental model** for time:

**Timestamps are not absolute truth—they are evidence of ordering, with bounded uncertainty.**

Every timestamp has:
- **Scope**: What it applies to (single event, transaction, epoch)
- **Lifetime**: How long it's valid (until clock drift exceeds bounds)
- **Binding**: What entity generated it (which clock, which node)
- **Uncertainty**: The error bounds (±ε)

Understanding time through this lens transforms debugging: "This timestamp proves event A happened-before event B within our clock drift bounds (±10ms), so causality is preserved."

### The Conservation Principle

Throughout this chapter, observe the **conservation of certainty**: you cannot create ordering information from nothing. Every ordering claim requires evidence:

- **Physical clocks**: Evidence from oscillators, bounded by drift rates
- **Logical clocks**: Evidence from message causality, bounded by communication patterns
- **Hybrid clocks**: Evidence from both, bounded by physical drift + logical gaps
- **TrueTime intervals**: Evidence of uncertainty itself, bounded by GPS + atomic clocks

When evidence is insufficient, systems must degrade:
- From linearizable (real-time order) to sequential (some order)
- From fresh reads to bounded-stale reads
- From causal consistency to eventual consistency

The degradation must be **explicit, principled, and safe**—never silent.

### Chapter Structure

**Part 1: Intuition (First Pass)** — We'll experience the problem viscerally through stories:
- The birthday paradox of distributed time
- Why wall clocks lie in practice
- The causality puzzle in real systems

**Part 2: Understanding (Second Pass)** — We'll build mental models of solutions:
- Physical time (NTP, PTP, hardware)
- Logical time (Lamport, vector clocks)

**Part 3: Mastery (Third Pass)** — We'll compose and operate time systems:

Let's begin with the birthday paradox—a story that makes the impossibility of synchronized time visceral and undeniable.

## Part 1: INTUITION (First Pass) — The Felt Need

### The Birthday Paradox of Distributed Time

Alice and Bob live on opposite sides of the world. They want to celebrate their shared birthday (October 1st) simultaneously by lighting candles at exactly midnight in their respective time zones. But there's a twist: they want to verify afterward that they actually lit the candles at the same instant.

**Attempt 1: Wall Clock Timestamps**

Alice lights her candle at `2025-10-01T00:00:00.000 EST` (New York). Bob lights his at `2025-10-01T00:00:00.000 GMT` (London). They compare timestamps. Alice's timestamp, converted to GMT, is `2025-10-01T05:00:00.000 GMT`. They lit candles 5 hours apart. Expected—they're in different time zones.

So they agree: "Let's both light candles at `2025-10-01T00:00:00.000 UTC`."

Alice's computer clock reads `2025-10-01T00:00:00.000 UTC`. She lights her candle.
Bob's computer clock reads `2025-10-01T00:00:00.000 UTC`. He lights his candle.

Did they light candles simultaneously?

**No.** Alice's computer clock was 120 milliseconds slow (NTP hadn't updated yet). Bob's was 80 milliseconds fast (bad crystal oscillator). The actual times were:

- Alice: `2025-09-30T23:59:59.880 UTC` (120ms before midnight)
- Bob: `2025-10-01T00:00:00.080 UTC` (80ms after midnight)

They were 200 milliseconds apart. In human terms, imperceptible. In distributed systems terms, an eternity—enough time for 100 network messages, 20 database commits, or 1000 cache invalidations.

**The problem**: You cannot rely on independent clocks to agree on "now" to millisecond precision.

**Attempt 2: Synchronize Clocks First**

"Fine," they say, "let's synchronize our clocks using NTP (Network Time Protocol) first."

NTP works by:
1. Client sends request to time server with timestamp T1
2. Server receives at T2 (server clock), responds at T3
3. Client receives response at T4
4. Estimate offset: `offset = ((T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4)) / 2`
5. Estimate delay: `delay = (T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)`

If delay is symmetric (request and response take equal time), offset is accurate. But network delays are asymmetric. The request might take 10ms, response 50ms. Offset calculation assumes 30ms each. Error: ±20ms.

Alice and Bob synchronize with NTP. Best-case accuracy: ±1ms (ideal conditions, low latency, symmetric network). Typical accuracy: ±10-50ms (realistic internet). Worst-case: ±100ms+ (congested network, asymmetric routes).

They light their candles again. Are they synchronized within 1ms? Maybe. Within 10ms? Probably. Within 100ms? Almost certainly.

**But they have no way to know the uncertainty.** NTP gives them a timestamp, not an interval. They cannot prove they were synchronized.

**Attempt 3: What If Precision Doesn't Matter?**

"Maybe we don't need millisecond precision," they say. "Let's just agree on the order of events."

Alice: "I'll send you a message when I light my candle. You light yours after receiving my message. Order preserved: mine, then yours."

Alice lights candle at T=0, sends message.
Network delay: 80ms.
Bob receives message at T=80ms (his local clock), lights candle.

This works! Bob's candle provably lit **after** Alice's, regardless of clock skew.

But now they notice: Bob's clock read T=80ms when he received the message, but Alice's clock read T=0 when she sent it. If they later compare timestamps (Alice: T=0, Bob: T=80), the 80ms difference isn't clock skew—it's network delay + causality.

**The insight**: Order is more fundamental than time. If we have a causal relationship (Alice's message caused Bob's action), we can establish order without trusting clocks.

This is **logical time**—the foundation of Lamport clocks.

### Why Wall Clocks Lie

Physical clocks are not sources of truth. They are **instruments that drift, skip, and jump**. Let's see how.

#### Clock Skew in Practice

Every computer has a crystal oscillator (usually 32.768 kHz—chosen because 2^15 = 32768, convenient for binary circuits). This crystal vibrates at a precise frequency, and the system counts vibrations to measure time.

But "precise" is relative:

- **Perfect crystal**: 32,768.000 Hz
- **Typical crystal**: 32,768.000 Hz ± 50 ppm (parts per million)
- **Bad crystal**: 32,768.000 Hz ± 200 ppm

**What does ±50 ppm mean?**
- 50 ppm = 0.005% error
- Over 1 day (86,400 seconds): 86,400 × 0.00005 = 4.32 seconds drift
- Over 1 year: 1,577 seconds = 26 minutes drift

**In a datacenter with 1,000 servers**, assuming random drift:
- After 1 day without synchronization: clocks spread across 4.32 seconds (standard deviation ~1.5s)
- After 1 week: spread across 30 seconds
- After 1 month: spread across 2 minutes

**Real example**: Google measured clock drift in datacenters (2012 Spanner paper):
- Typical drift: 200 μs/sec (200 ppm)
- 99th percentile: 400 μs/sec
- Worst-case: 6 ms/sec (clock hardware failure)

Without synchronization, clocks diverge linearly with time. NTP combats this by periodically synchronizing, but between synchronizations, drift accumulates.

#### NTP Stepping Backward

NTP adjusts clocks in two ways:

1. **Slewing**: Gradually speed up or slow down the clock (if offset <128ms)
   - Example: Clock is 50ms slow, NTP speeds it up by 0.01% until it catches up
   - Takes ~5000 seconds (83 minutes) to correct 50ms
   - Time remains monotonic (never goes backward)

2. **Stepping**: Jump the clock immediately (if offset ≥128ms)
   - Example: Clock is 200ms slow, NTP adds 200ms instantly
   - Or worse: clock is 200ms fast, NTP subtracts 200ms (time goes backward!)
   - Violates monotonicity

**Why stepping is dangerous**:

```
T=1000: Process records event A with timestamp 1000
T=1010: NTP steps clock backward by 200ms
T=810:  Process records event B with timestamp 810
```

Event B happened **after** A, but has an earlier timestamp. If you sort events by timestamp, you conclude B happened before A. **Causality inverted.**

**Real incident**: A financial trading system used wall-clock timestamps to order trades. NTP stepped a clock backward by 150ms during a market spike. Trades recorded in the wrong order. Regulatory violation. Multi-million dollar fine.

**Defense**: Never use wall-clock time for ordering. Use **monotonic clocks**—clocks that never go backward, only pause or slow down.

#### The Leap Second Problem

Earth's rotation is slowing down (tidal friction from the Moon). Occasionally, we add a "leap second" to keep atomic time (TAI) aligned with Earth's rotation (UT1). UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) includes leap seconds.

**What happens during a leap second**:

Normal: `23:59:58 → 23:59:59 → 00:00:00`
Leap second: `23:59:58 → 23:59:59 → 23:59:60 → 00:00:00`

Systems expect 60 seconds per minute. A 61-second minute breaks assumptions:

- **Time goes backward** (some systems implement 23:59:60 as 23:59:59 again)
- **Time freezes** (some systems repeat 23:59:59 for two seconds)
- **Systems crash** (assumptions like `assert(time_diff >= 0)` fail)

**The Cloudflare Incident (2017)**:

On New Year's Day 2017, a leap second occurred. Cloudflare's DNS infrastructure used a timer library that computed durations by subtracting timestamps. When time repeated (23:59:59 occurred twice), some durations were negative. The code:

```go
duration := time.Now() - startTime
assert(duration >= 0)  // PANIC!
```

The assertion failed. Processes crashed. DNS resolution failed globally. 90 minutes of downtime.

**The fix**: Use monotonic clocks (Go's `time.Now()` for wall time, but `time.Since()` for durations, which uses monotonic clock internally). Or, avoid leap seconds entirely.

**Google's Leap Smear**:

Instead of adding a leap second at midnight, Google "smears" it: gradually slow down all clocks over 20 hours, adding 1/72000th of a second to each second. Total: 1 second added over 20 hours. No discontinuity.

Trade-off: During the smear, Google's clocks are slightly out of sync with true UTC (up to 0.5s). But they're monotonic, and services don't crash.

#### Virtual Machine Clock Drift

Virtual machines add another layer of time distortion. The hypervisor multiplexes CPU time among VMs. When a VM is paused (CPU stolen for another VM or host maintenance), its clock might:

- **Stop entirely** (VM not scheduled)
- **Jump forward** (VM resumes, reads host clock, sees 100ms elapsed)
- **Run fast** (VM compensates for lost time by speeding up its clock)

**Example**:

VM A is running a consensus protocol. It sends a heartbeat with timestamp T=1000. The hypervisor pauses VM A for 150ms (CPU contention). VM A resumes at T=1150, sends the next heartbeat. But VM B, running on a different host, saw no heartbeat for 150ms and suspects VM A crashed. VM B initiates a leader election, even though VM A is fine.

**False failure detection** due to clock pauses. The consensus protocol's liveness is compromised.

**Defense**:
- Pin VMs to dedicated CPU cores (expensive)
- Use PTP (Precision Time Protocol) with hardware timestamping (bypasses VM clock)
- Design protocols to tolerate pauses (increase timeout thresholds)

### The Causality Puzzle

Ordering isn't just about timestamps—it's about **causality**: which events could have influenced which others.

#### The Twitter Timeline Problem

You tweet: "I love distributed systems!" (Event A)
Your friend replies: "Me too!" (Event B)

Event B is causally dependent on A (they saw your tweet, then replied). Any correct ordering must show A before B.

Now imagine:
- Your server timestamp (A): `12:00:00.100 UTC`
- Friend's server timestamp (B): `12:00:00.080 UTC`

Timestamps say B happened before A. But causality says A happened before B. **Conflict.**

This happens in practice. Twitter (and other social media) have occasionally shown replies before the original tweet. Users see:

```
> Me too!
  (What are they replying to?)
> I love distributed systems!
  (Oh, the reply came first in the timeline)
```

**Cause**: Clock skew between datacenters. Event A recorded in US-East with slow clock. Event B recorded in EU-West with fast clock. Timeline sorted by timestamp shows B before A, violating causality.

**Fix**: Use **causal consistency**: track causality explicitly (not via timestamps), ensure dependent events are ordered correctly. Implementations: vector clocks, causal broadcast protocols.

#### Message Replies Before Original

In distributed messaging systems (Slack, Discord, email), message ordering matters:

Message 1 (Alice): "Should we deploy today?"
Message 2 (Bob, replying to 1): "Yes, let's do it."
Message 3 (Carol, replying to 2): "I'll handle the rollout."

If timestamps are used and clocks are skewed:
- Message 1: `12:00:00.150`
- Message 2: `12:00:00.100` (fast clock)
- Message 3: `12:00:00.200`

Sorted by timestamp: `Message 2 → Message 1 → Message 3`

Carol's message says "I'll handle the rollout," but users see it before Bob's "Yes, let's do it," and even before Alice's question. **Completely incoherent conversation.**

**Real incident**: Slack experienced this in 2016. Clock skew between backend servers caused messages to appear out of order in channels. User confusion. Support tickets spiked. The fix involved hybrid logical clocks (HLC) to preserve causality.

#### The Distributed Debugging Nightmare

You're debugging a failure. Logs from three services:

```
[ServiceA] 12:00:00.120 - Sent request to ServiceB (request_id=42)
[ServiceB] 12:00:00.090 - Received request (request_id=42)
[ServiceB] 12:00:00.095 - Error: Invalid token
[ServiceA] 12:00:00.130 - Received error from ServiceB
```

Wait. ServiceB received the request at 090, before ServiceA sent it at 120? **Time travel?**

No—clock skew. ServiceA's clock is 50ms ahead of ServiceB's. The actual order:

1. ServiceA sends request (ServiceA clock: 120, real time: ~100)
2. ServiceB receives request (ServiceB clock: 90, real time: ~100)
3. ServiceB processes, encounters error (ServiceB clock: 95)
4. ServiceA receives error (ServiceA clock: 130, real time: ~110)

To reconstruct causality, you need to **correlate clocks** or use **causality tracking** (like distributed tracing with span IDs, which form a causal DAG independent of timestamps).

**Modern solution**: OpenTelemetry and distributed tracing use **trace IDs** and **span IDs** to track causality. Spans have parent-child relationships forming a tree. Order is determined by the tree structure, not timestamps. Timestamps are for human interpretation only.

## Part 2: UNDERSTANDING (Second Pass) — Building Mental Models

### Physical Time: The Messy Reality

Let's understand how physical time actually works, starting from hardware and building up to protocols.

#### Clock Hardware: From Crystals to Atoms

**Quartz Crystal Oscillators (32.768 kHz)**

The cheapest and most common time source. A quartz crystal vibrates when voltage is applied. Count vibrations, divide by 32,768, get 1 second.

Properties:
- **Accuracy**: ±50 ppm (typical), ±20 ppm (good), ±200 ppm (poor)
- **Drift rate**: 1-10 seconds per day
- **Temperature sensitivity**: Drift increases with temperature changes
- **Aging**: Frequency drifts over months/years as crystal structure changes
- **Cost**: $0.10 - $1

**Temperature-Compensated Crystal Oscillators (TCXO)**

Add temperature sensors and adjust frequency dynamically.

Properties:
- **Accuracy**: ±1 ppm (typical)
- **Drift rate**: 0.1 seconds per day
- **Cost**: $5 - $50

**Atomic Clocks**

Use atomic transitions (cesium-133 or rubidium-87) as reference. 1 second = 9,192,631,770 cesium-133 hyperfine transitions.

Properties:
- **Accuracy**: ±10^-12 (cesium), ±10^-9 (rubidium)
- **Drift rate**: 1 microsecond per month (cesium)
- **Cost**: $1,000 - $100,000
- **Size**: Rack-mounted units

**GPS Receivers**

Receive atomic clock signals from GPS satellites. GPS satellites have cesium/rubidium clocks (±10^-12 accuracy). Receiver computes time from satellite signals.

Properties:
- **Accuracy**: ±10-100 nanoseconds (with clear sky view)
- **Dependency**: Requires line-of-sight to 4+ satellites
- **Vulnerability**: Spoofing, jamming, atmospheric interference
- **Cost**: $50 - $500

**Which to use?**

| Use Case | Clock | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Consumer devices | Quartz (32.768 kHz) | Cost, power |
| Servers (NTP synced) | Quartz | Cost, NTP corrects drift |
| Datacenters (PTP) | TCXO + GPS | Accuracy, PTP needs stable reference |
| Financial trading | GPS + atomic | Regulatory requirements (microsecond accuracy) |
| Spanner (Google) | GPS + atomic ensemble | TrueTime uncertainty bounds |

#### NTP (Network Time Protocol)

NTP synchronizes clocks over a network using a hierarchy:

**Stratum Levels**:
- **Stratum 0**: Atomic clocks, GPS receivers (reference clocks, not on network)
- **Stratum 1**: Servers directly connected to Stratum 0 (primary time servers)
- **Stratum 2**: Servers syncing from Stratum 1 (secondary time servers)
- **Stratum 3-15**: Clients syncing from higher strata
- **Stratum 16**: Unsynchronized

**Algorithm**:

1. **Poll interval**: Client queries server every 64-1024 seconds (adaptive)
2. **Offset estimation**: As described in the birthday paradox (4-way handshake)
3. **Delay estimation**: Round-trip time (RTT), used to filter outliers
4. **Filtering**: Collect 8 samples, discard outliers, average remaining
5. **Clock discipline**: Adjust local clock via slewing (gradual) or stepping (immediate)

**Accuracy**:
- **LAN**: ±1 ms (low latency, symmetric paths)
- **Internet**: ±10-50 ms (asymmetric routes, congestion)
- **Constrained networks**: ±100+ ms (high latency, packet loss)

**Failure modes**:
- **Network partition**: Client cannot reach time servers → clock drifts
- **Asymmetric latency**: Request takes 5ms, response takes 50ms → offset error ±22.5ms
- **Congestion**: Delayed packets → timeout, retry, eventual step
- **Malicious server**: Attacker serves wrong time → client's clock is poisoned

**Clock discipline details**:

If offset < 128ms: **Slew** the clock
- Adjust clock frequency by small amount (e.g., +0.01%)
- Clock runs slightly fast/slow until offset corrected
- Takes minutes to hours
- Maintains monotonicity (time never goes backward)

If offset ≥ 128ms: **Step** the clock
- Immediately add/subtract offset
- Time may go backward (if clock was fast)
- Violates monotonicity
- May break applications

**NTP's limitation**: Provides a single timestamp, not an uncertainty bound. You get `T = 12:00:00.000`, but not `T ∈ [11:59:59.990, 12:00:00.010]`. Applications don't know the error.

#### PTP (Precision Time Protocol / IEEE 1588)

PTP achieves sub-microsecond synchronization using **hardware timestamping**—network interface cards (NICs) timestamp packets at the physical layer, bypassing OS delays.

**How PTP works**:

1. **Grandmaster clock**: The most accurate clock (usually GPS-synchronized)
2. **Sync messages**: Grandmaster broadcasts sync messages with precise timestamps
3. **Hardware timestamps**: NICs record exact time packet sent/received (bypassing kernel, TCP stack)
4. **Delay measurement**: Bidirectional exchange to estimate path delay
5. **Clock adjustment**: Clients adjust clocks to match grandmaster within nanoseconds

**Accuracy**:
- **Without hardware timestamping**: ±1 μs (microsecond)
- **With hardware timestamping**: ±100 ns (nanosecond)
- **Best case (same rack, PTP-aware switches)**: ±10 ns

**Requirements**:
- **Hardware support**: PTP-capable NICs (Intel i210, Mellanox ConnectX-5)
- **Network support**: PTP-aware switches (Transparent Clock mode to correct for switch delay)
- **Stable physical layer**: Low jitter, symmetric paths

**Use cases**:
- **Financial trading**: Regulatory requirements (MiFID II: microsecond timestamp accuracy)
- **5G networks**: Synchronized base stations (nanosecond accuracy)
- **Industrial automation**: Synchronized sensors/actuators
- **Data center infrastructure**: High-precision time for distributed databases

**Limitations**:
- **Cost**: Specialized hardware (NICs, switches)
- **Deployment complexity**: Requires physical infrastructure changes
- **Vulnerability**: Like NTP, vulnerable to grandmaster failure or network partition

#### Physical Time Summary

| Protocol/Hardware | Accuracy | Cost | Use Case |
|-------------------|----------|------|----------|
| Quartz oscillator | ±50 ppm (4 sec/day) | $1 | Consumer devices |
| TCXO | ±1 ppm (0.1 sec/day) | $50 | Servers |
| Atomic clock | ±10^-12 | $10,000 | Stratum 1 servers |
| GPS receiver | ±100 ns | $500 | Datacenter reference |
| NTP (internet) | ±10-50 ms | $0 (software) | General servers |
| NTP (LAN) | ±1 ms | $0 (software) | Same-datacenter |
| PTP (hardware) | ±100 ns | $1,000+ | Financial, 5G, critical infra |

**Key insight**: Physical time gives you **bounded uncertainty**, not absolute truth. The uncertainty bound depends on:
- Clock hardware quality (drift rate)
- Synchronization protocol (NTP vs PTP)
- Network characteristics (latency, symmetry)
- Time since last sync (drift accumulation)

**Evidence view**: A physical timestamp is evidence of ordering with uncertainty `±ε`, where `ε` depends on the above factors. As time passes without resynchronization, `ε` grows.

### Logical Time: Order Without Clocks

If physical clocks are unreliable, can we establish order without them? Yes—using **causality** instead of time.

#### Lamport Clocks: The Happens-Before Relation

**The insight**: If event A could have caused event B (via message passing), then A happened-before B, regardless of physical time.

**Happened-before relation** (denoted `→`):

1. If A and B occur on the same process and A occurs before B locally, then `A → B`
2. If A is sending a message and B is receiving that message, then `A → B`
3. If `A → B` and `B → C`, then `A → C` (transitivity)

**If neither `A → B` nor `B → A`, then A and B are concurrent (`A ∥ B`).**

**Lamport's algorithm**:

Each process maintains a logical clock `LC` (integer counter):

1. **Initialize**: `LC = 0`
2. **Local event**: `LC = LC + 1`
3. **Send message**: Attach `LC` to message, then `LC = LC + 1`
4. **Receive message** with timestamp `LC_msg`: `LC = max(LC, LC_msg) + 1`

**Example**:

```
Process P1:
  Event A: LC=1 (local event)
  Event B: LC=2 (send message with LC=2)

Process P2:
  Event C: LC=1 (local event)
  Event D: LC=3 (receive message with LC=2, set LC=max(1,2)+1=3)
  Event E: LC=4 (local event)
```

**Ordering property**:
- If `A → B`, then `LC(A) < LC(B)`

**But the converse is NOT true**:
- If `LC(A) < LC(B)`, we cannot conclude `A → B` (they might be concurrent)

**Example**: Event C (LC=1) and Event A (LC=1) have equal LC values but are concurrent (neither caused the other). Lamport clocks cannot detect concurrency.

**Use cases**:
- **Consistent snapshots**: Take snapshot when LC values align
- **Causal broadcast**: Deliver message only after all messages with lower LC
- **Mutual exclusion**: Totally order lock requests by `(LC, ProcessID)`

**Limitations**:
- **Cannot detect concurrency**: If `LC(A) = LC(B)`, we don't know if `A ∥ B` or `A → B`
- **No physical time**: Cannot answer "how long did this take?"
- **Integer overflow**: LC grows unbounded (though slowly in practice)

**Evidence view**: Lamport clock value is evidence of causal ordering. If `LC(A) < LC(B)`, we have evidence that `A` did not happen after `B`. But if `LC(A) = LC(B)`, we have no evidence of order.

#### Vector Clocks: Detecting Concurrency

Vector clocks solve Lamport's limitation: they can detect concurrency.

**Idea**: Each process maintains a vector of logical clocks, one entry per process.

**Algorithm** (for N processes):

Each process P_i maintains a vector `VC_i = [c_1, c_2, ..., c_N]`:

1. **Initialize**: `VC_i = [0, 0, ..., 0]`
2. **Local event**: `VC_i[i] = VC_i[i] + 1`
3. **Send message**: Attach `VC_i` to message, then `VC_i[i] = VC_i[i] + 1`
4. **Receive message** with `VC_msg`:
   - For all j: `VC_i[j] = max(VC_i[j], VC_msg[j])`
   - Then: `VC_i[i] = VC_i[i] + 1`

**Comparison**:

- `VC(A) < VC(B)` if for all i: `VC(A)[i] ≤ VC(B)[i]` and exists j: `VC(A)[j] < VC(B)[j]`
  - This means `A → B` (A happened-before B)

- `VC(A) ∥ VC(B)` if neither `VC(A) < VC(B)` nor `VC(B) < VC(A)`
  - This means A and B are concurrent

**Example** (3 processes):

```
Process P1:
  Event A: VC=[1,0,0]
  Event B: VC=[2,0,0] (send to P2)

Process P2:
  Event C: VC=[0,1,0]
  Event D: VC=[2,2,0] (receive from P1, merge: max([0,1,0], [2,0,0])=[2,1,0], then increment: [2,2,0])

Process P3:
  Event E: VC=[0,0,1]
```

**Comparisons**:
- `VC(A) = [1,0,0]` vs `VC(D) = [2,2,0]`: `A → D` (A happened-before D)
- `VC(A) = [1,0,0]` vs `VC(E) = [0,0,1]`: `A ∥ E` (concurrent)

**Use cases**:
- **Conflict detection**: If two writes W1 and W2 have `W1 ∥ W2`, they conflict
- **Causal consistency**: Track dependencies, deliver operations in causal order
- **Distributed debugging**: Reconstruct happens-before relationship from logs
- **Version control** (Git uses a form of vector clock for commits)

**Space complexity**: O(N) per event, where N = number of processes. For large systems (thousands of nodes), this is expensive.

**Pruning strategies**:
- **Compact representation**: Store only non-zero entries
- **Garbage collection**: Discard old vector entries after causal dependencies no longer needed
- **Version vectors**: Use per-object (not per-process) granularity

**Evidence view**: Vector clock is evidence of full causal history. `VC(A)` is evidence of all events that causally precede A. Concurrency detection is explicit: absence of ordering evidence means concurrent.

#### Interval Tree Clocks (ITC): Addressing Vector Clock Limitations

Vector clocks scale poorly with process count. Interval Tree Clocks (ITC) address this by representing causality with tree structures.

**Key ideas**:
- **Dynamic process IDs**: Processes can fork (split ID space) and join (merge ID space)
- **Compact representation**: Tree structure instead of flat vector
- **Fork-join-retire**: Explicitly model process lifecycle

**Algorithm sketch** (simplified):

An ITC event is `(id, event)`, where:
- `id`: A tree representing the process's identity (its portion of the ID space)
- `event`: A tree representing the causal history

Operations:
- **Fork**: Split ID space between parent and child
- **Event**: Increment local event counter
- **Join**: Merge two ITC clocks (like vector clock merge)
- **Retire**: Remove process from ID space

**Use case**: Systems with dynamic membership (processes joining and leaving frequently), like:
- Mobile applications (devices come and go)
- Peer-to-peer networks (nodes join and leave)
- Serverless functions (ephemeral execution)

**Benefit**: Space complexity grows with active processes, not total processes. If you have 1000 processes but only 10 active at a time, ITC uses O(10) space, not O(1000).

**Limitations**:
- **Complexity**: More complex to implement than vector clocks
- **Overhead**: Tree operations (fork, join) have computational cost
- **Adoption**: Less widely used (vector clocks are more common)

### Hybrid Approaches: Best of Both Worlds

Logical clocks give causal order but no physical time. Physical clocks give physical time but with unbounded drift. Can we combine them?

#### Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC): Bounded Drift with Causality

**Idea**: Combine physical time (for human-readable timestamps) with logical time (for causality).

**HLC algorithm**:

Each process maintains:
- `pt`: Physical time (from system clock)
- `l`: Logical time (maximum physical time seen)
- `c`: Logical counter (to break ties when `l = pt`)

State: `HLC = (l, c)`

**On local event**:
```
pt = physical_time()
if pt > l:
    l = pt
    c = 0
else:
    c = c + 1
```

**On send message**:
Same as local event, then attach `(l, c)` to message.

**On receive message** with `(l_msg, c_msg)`:
```
pt = physical_time()
l' = max(l, l_msg, pt)
if l' == l and l' == l_msg:
    c = max(c, c_msg) + 1
elif l' == l:
    c = c + 1
elif l' == l_msg:
    c = c_msg + 1
else:
    c = 0
l = l'
```

**Properties**:

1. **Happens-before**: If `A → B`, then `HLC(A) < HLC(B)`
2. **Bounded drift from physical time**: `|l - pt| ≤ ε`, where `ε` depends on clock drift and message delay
3. **Human-readable**: `l` is a physical timestamp (can be converted to UTC)
4. **Tie-breaking**: `c` breaks ties when physical times align

**Use case**: **CockroachDB** uses HLC for transaction timestamps:
- All transactions stamped with HLC
- Causality preserved (dependent transactions have ordered HLC values)
- Timestamps human-readable (debugging, monitoring)
- Bounded drift ensures timestamps don't diverge wildly from physical time

**Bounded drift proof**:

Assume clock drift rate `ρ` (e.g., 200 ppm = 200 μs/sec).
Assume maximum message delay `δ` (e.g., 10 ms in LAN).

Then: `|l - pt| ≤ ρ × δ`

Example:
- `ρ = 200 μs/sec = 0.0002`
- `δ = 10 ms = 0.01 sec`
- Bound: `|l - pt| ≤ 0.0002 × 0.01 = 2 μs`

In practice, the bound is larger due to network variability, but it's still **bounded**, unlike Lamport clocks (which can drift arbitrarily far from physical time).

**Evidence view**: HLC timestamp is evidence of both causality (via `l` and `c` ordering) and physical time (via `l` being close to `pt`). The evidence has two components:
- Causal evidence: `HLC(A) < HLC(B)` ⇒ `A → B`
- Temporal evidence: `l` ∈ `[pt - ε, pt + ε]`

#### TrueTime: Uncertainty as a Feature

Google Spanner's **TrueTime** takes a radical approach: **make uncertainty explicit**.

**API**:

```
TT.now() → [earliest, latest]
```

Returns an **interval**, not a point. The current time is guaranteed to be within this interval.

**How it works**:

Google datacenters have:
- **GPS receivers** (accurate to ~100 ns, but vulnerable to signal loss)
- **Atomic clocks** (cesium/rubidium, accurate to ~10^-12, but drift over time)

Each server queries both:
- GPS time: `T_gps ± ε_gps`
- Atomic time: `T_atomic ± ε_atomic`

Cross-check:
- If `|T_gps - T_atomic| < threshold`: Trust both, return interval `[min(T_gps, T_atomic) - max(ε_gps, ε_atomic), max(T_gps, T_atomic) + max(ε_gps, ε_atomic)]`
- If `|T_gps - T_atomic| ≥ threshold`: One source has failed, increase uncertainty

**Typical uncertainty**: ±1-7 ms (average 4 ms)

**Why uncertainty matters**:

Consider two transactions:
- T1 commits at physical time 100
- T2 reads at physical time 105

Did T2's read happen after T1's commit? If clocks are perfectly synchronized, yes. But with clock skew:
- T1's clock might be 10 ms fast: T1 actually committed at physical time 110 (after T2's read at 105!)

**Spanner's solution**: **Commit-wait protocol**

When committing transaction T1 with timestamp `t`:
1. Get TrueTime interval: `[earliest, latest]`
2. Choose commit timestamp `t = latest` (upper bound)
3. **Wait** until `TT.now().earliest > t` (ensure physical time has definitely passed `t`)
4. Only then report commit

This ensures: Any subsequent transaction that gets a timestamp after T1's commit will have a timestamp `> t`, guaranteeing external consistency (linearizability across datacenters).

**The wait is the price of certainty**:
- Average uncertainty: 4 ms
- Average commit-wait: 4 ms added to every transaction

**Trade-off**: Spanner chooses latency (commit-wait) to get consistency (external consistency). This is PACELC: EC (else, consistency).

**Why GPS + atomic clocks?**

- **GPS alone**: Vulnerable to signal loss (indoors, atmospheric interference, jamming). If GPS fails, uncertainty grows unbounded.
- **Atomic clocks alone**: Drift over time. Without GPS to recalibrate, uncertainty grows linearly.
- **Both together**: GPS provides periodic calibration. Atomic clocks provide stability between GPS signals. If GPS fails temporarily, atomic clocks bound the drift rate.

**Uncertainty growth during GPS outage**:
- Atomic clock drift: ~200 μs/sec
- After 10 seconds without GPS: uncertainty = 2 ms
- After 1 minute: uncertainty = 12 ms
- After 10 minutes: uncertainty = 120 ms (unacceptable)

Spanner alerts operators if uncertainty exceeds 10 ms, indicating GPS failure.

**Evidence view**: TrueTime interval `[earliest, latest]` is evidence with explicit uncertainty bounds. The evidence is:
- **Scope**: Global (all Spanner nodes agree on interval overlap)
- **Lifetime**: Until next TrueTime call (uncertainty increases with time)
- **Binding**: Physical time reference (GPS + atomic clocks)
- **Uncertainty**: `latest - earliest` (explicit)

Commit-wait converts uncertain evidence into certain evidence by waiting out the uncertainty.

### Causality and Consistency

Time and order are means to an end: **consistency**. What do we mean by consistent?

#### Causal Consistency

**Definition**: If operation A causally precedes operation B (A → B), then all processes observe A before B.

**Causal precedence** (`→`):
1. Same-session: Operations in the same session are causally ordered
2. Read-from: If transaction T1 writes X and T2 reads X, then T1 → T2
3. Transitivity: If A → B and B → C, then A → C

**Example**:

```
Alice writes X=1 (W1)
Bob reads X=1, then writes Y=2 (R1, W2)
Carol reads Y=2 (R2)
```

Causal order: `W1 → R1 → W2 → R2`

**Causal consistency** ensures Carol also sees X=1 (from W1), because W1 → W2 → R2.

**Contrast with eventual consistency**:
- **Eventual**: Carol might see Y=2 but X=0 (old value), temporarily violating causality
- **Causal**: Carol sees Y=2 ⇒ she must see X=1

**Implementation**: Track causal dependencies using:
- **Vector clocks**: Attach vector clock to each operation, deliver in causal order
- **Dependency tracking**: Explicitly record dependencies (e.g., "W2 depends on R1")
- **Causal broadcast**: Ensure messages delivered in causal order

**Use case**: Collaborative editing, social media timelines, distributed databases (e.g., Riak with causal contexts).

**Guarantee vector**: `⟨Range, Causal, RA, BS(δ), Idem(K), Auth⟩`
- Causal order preserved within bounded staleness

#### Closed Timestamps: Advancing Consistency Frontiers

**Problem**: To serve consistent reads from replicas, we need to know: "Has all data up to timestamp T been replicated?"

**Closed timestamp** (also called **safe timestamp**): A timestamp T such that no future writes will have timestamp < T.

**How it works**:

Leader tracks:
- **Open timestamps**: Transactions currently in-flight with timestamp T
- **Closed timestamp**: Maximum T such that all transactions with timestamp ≤ T have committed

Example:
```
T=100: Transaction A commits
T=105: Transaction B in-flight
T=110: Transaction C commits
```

Closed timestamp = 100 (because B at T=105 is still in-flight).

Once B commits at T=105:
```
Closed timestamp = 110
```

**Now replicas can serve reads at T ≤ 110**, knowing all data up to T=110 is replicated.

**CockroachDB implementation**:

- Leader broadcasts closed timestamp to replicas every 200 ms
- Replicas serve reads at `T ≤ closed_timestamp`
- If read requires `T > closed_timestamp`, wait or redirect to leader

**Follower reads** (reading from replicas instead of leader):
- **Without closed timestamps**: Can't guarantee freshness (replica might be lagging)
- **With closed timestamps**: Can guarantee freshness up to `closed_timestamp`

**Trade-off**:
- Closed timestamp lags leader by ~200 ms (bounded staleness)
- Reads are faster (no leader bottleneck)
- Writes unaffected (still go to leader)

**Guarantee vector**:
- Leader: `⟨Range, Lx, SI, Fresh(φ), Idem, Auth⟩`
- Replica: `⟨Range, Lx, SI, BS(200ms), Idem, Auth⟩`

**Evidence**: Closed timestamp is evidence that all prior writes have replicated. Evidence lifetime = until next closed timestamp update.

## Part 3: MASTERY (Third Pass) — Composition and Operation

### Evidence-Based Time Systems

Let's formalize timestamps as evidence with the full lifecycle.

#### Timestamps as Evidence

Every timestamp has:

**Scope**: What does it apply to?
- **Event**: Single operation (e.g., log entry)
- **Transaction**: Group of operations (e.g., database transaction)
- **Epoch**: Configuration period (e.g., leader term in Raft)
- **Global**: Entire system (e.g., TrueTime interval)

**Lifetime**: How long is it valid?
- **Physical timestamp**: Valid until clock drift exceeds bounds (e.g., 10 seconds without NTP sync)
- **Logical timestamp**: Valid until causal dependencies change (e.g., new message received)
- **HLC**: Valid until physical drift bound exceeded (e.g., ρ × δ)
- **TrueTime interval**: Valid until next `TT.now()` call

**Binding**: What entity generated it?
- **Process ID**: Which process's clock?
- **Replica ID**: Which replica?
- **Datacenter ID**: Which datacenter?
- **Clock source**: NTP server, GPS, atomic clock?

**Transitivity**: Can it be forwarded?
- **Transitive**: Downstream services can rely on it (e.g., HLC causality)
- **Non-transitive**: Must be re-validated at boundaries (e.g., physical timestamp from untrusted client)

**Uncertainty**: What are the error bounds?
- **NTP**: ±10-50 ms (typical)
- **PTP**: ±100 ns (hardware timestamping)
- **TrueTime**: ±1-7 ms (explicit interval)
- **Logical clocks**: No physical uncertainty, but no physical meaning

#### The Evidence Lifecycle

**Generation**:
- **Physical**: Read system clock (with drift since last sync)
- **Logical**: Increment counter (Lamport) or merge vectors (vector clock)
- **Hybrid**: Merge physical + logical (HLC)
- **TrueTime**: Query GPS + atomic clock ensemble, compute interval

**Validation**:
- **Boundary check**: Is timestamp within expected bounds? (e.g., not in future, not too far in past)
- **Causality check**: Does it preserve happens-before? (e.g., HLC(A) < HLC(B) for dependent ops)
- **Freshness check**: Is drift within tolerance? (e.g., `|t - pt| < ε`)

**Active Use**:
- **Ordering**: Sort events by timestamp
- **Conflict detection**: Compare timestamps to detect concurrent writes
- **Freshness**: Compare timestamp to staleness bound (e.g., `now - t < δ`)

**Expiration**:
- **Physical**: After clock drift exceeds bounds (e.g., 10 seconds without NTP)
- **Logical**: When causal dependencies change (new messages arrive)
- **Lease-based**: When lease expires (e.g., 5-second lease on leader role)

**Renewal**:
- **Resynchronize**: Contact NTP/PTP server, update clock
- **Refresh**: Increment logical clock, merge new causal info
- **Re-prove**: Reacquire lease, generate new epoch token

**Revocation**:
- **Clock failure**: Detect clock skew exceeds threshold, reject timestamps
- **Partition**: Detect network partition, invalidate timestamps from partitioned nodes
- **Epoch change**: New leader elected, old epoch's timestamps invalidated

### Time System Invariants

Every time system must preserve certain invariants. Let's catalog them.

#### Primary Invariant: ORDER

**Statement**: If event A happened-before event B in reality, then any ordering mechanism must not conclude B happened-before A.

**Formally**: `A → B` (in happened-before relation) ⇒ `T(A) < T(B)` (in timestamp ordering)

**Threat model**:
- **Clock skew**: Physical clocks differ, causing timestamp inversion
- **Message reordering**: Network delivers messages out of order
- **Replay attacks**: Old timestamp used for new event

**Protection**:
- **Lamport clocks**: Increment on each event, merge on message receive
- **Vector clocks**: Track full causal history
- **HLC**: Merge physical + logical time to preserve causality despite clock skew
- **Fencing tokens**: Epoch numbers prevent old timestamps from overriding new ones

**Evidence needed**: Causal evidence (vector clock, HLC) or ordered evidence (Lamport clock, sequence numbers)

**Degradation**: If causality cannot be determined (concurrent events), explicitly mark as concurrent (vector clock) or use tie-breaking (process ID, HLC counter).

#### Supporting Invariant: MONOTONICITY

**Statement**: Time never goes backward on a single process.

**Formally**: For all events E1, E2 on process P, if E1 occurs before E2 locally, then `T(E1) ≤ T(E2)`

**Threat model**:
- **NTP stepping backward**: Clock adjusted to earlier time
- **Leap seconds**: Time repeats (23:59:59 occurs twice)
- **VM clock reset**: Hypervisor resets VM clock after pause

**Protection**:
- **Monotonic clocks**: Use `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (Linux) or equivalent
- **Logical clocks**: Always increment, never decrement
- **HLC**: Ensures `l` is monotonic (even if `pt` goes backward)

**Evidence**: Monotonic clock reading (kernel-provided guarantee)

**Degradation**: If physical clock steps backward, fall back to logical time (HLC's `c` counter increments even if `pt` doesn't).

**Recovery**: Resynchronize clock (NTP/PTP), validate that new time is ≥ previous time.

#### Supporting Invariant: PROGRESS

**Statement**: Time eventually advances (system doesn't freeze).

**Formally**: For any timestamp T, there exists a future timestamp T' > T within bounded time.

**Threat model**:
- **Clock freeze**: Crystal oscillator fails, clock stops
- **NTP timeout**: Cannot reach time server, clock not updated
- **Counter overflow**: Logical clock counter reaches max value

**Protection**:
- **Watchdog timers**: Detect when clock hasn't advanced, alert operators
- **Heartbeats**: Periodic messages prove time is advancing
- **Counter range**: Use 64-bit counters (2^64 increments before overflow)

**Evidence**: Heartbeat with timestamp (proves clock advanced since last heartbeat)

**Degradation**: If physical clock frozen, fall back to logical clock (still advances). If both fail, enter degraded mode (reject new operations).

#### Supporting Invariant: BOUNDED-DRIFT

**Statement**: Physical timestamps stay within known bounds of true time.

**Formally**: `|T_physical - T_true| ≤ ε`, where `ε` is the drift bound

**Threat model**:
- **Crystal drift**: Clock drifts due to temperature, aging
- **NTP failure**: Sync lost, drift accumulates
- **Malicious time server**: Attacker poisons time

**Protection**:
- **Regular sync**: NTP/PTP sync every 64-1024 seconds
- **Drift monitoring**: Track `|T_physical - T_reference|`, alert if exceeds threshold
- **Multiple time sources**: Cross-check GPS + atomic clock (TrueTime)

**Evidence**: Time synchronization proof (NTP exchange, PTP sync)

**Degradation**: If drift exceeds ε, widen uncertainty bound (TrueTime) or fall back to logical time (HLC).

**Recovery**: Resynchronize with trusted time source, re-establish ε bounds.

### Mode Matrix for Time Systems

Let's define operational modes for time systems, with explicit guarantees and transitions.

#### Target Mode

**Invariants preserved**:
- **ORDER**: Happens-before preserved
- **MONOTONICITY**: Time never goes backward
- **PROGRESS**: Time advances
- **BOUNDED-DRIFT**: `|T_physical - T_true| ≤ ε`

**Evidence available**:
- **Fresh timestamps**: Synced within last 60 seconds (NTP)
- **Causal evidence**: HLC or vector clock tracks causality
- **Bounded uncertainty**: TrueTime interval width ≤ 10 ms

**Allowed operations**:
- **Linearizable reads**: Read with fresh timestamp
- **Serializable transactions**: Commit with HLC timestamp, causal order preserved
- **Follower reads**: Read from replica with closed timestamp

**Guarantee vector**: `⟨Global, Lx, SI, Fresh(φ), Idem, Auth⟩`

**Entry condition**: Clock synced successfully, drift < 10 ms

**Exit condition**: Drift > 10 ms or sync lost > 120 seconds

#### Degraded Mode

**Invariants preserved**:
- **ORDER**: Happens-before preserved (via logical clocks)
- **MONOTONICITY**: Time never goes backward (via monotonic clock)
- **PROGRESS**: Time advances (via logical clock)

**Invariants relaxed**:
- **BOUNDED-DRIFT**: May exceed ε (physical clock drift unbounded)

**Evidence available**:
- **Stale timestamps**: Last sync > 120 seconds ago
- **Causal evidence**: HLC or vector clock still valid
- **Wide uncertainty**: TrueTime interval width > 10 ms (or unbounded)

**Allowed operations**:
- **Bounded-stale reads**: Read with staleness bound `δ` (e.g., 200 ms)
- **Causal transactions**: Commit with HLC, causality preserved, but freshness degraded
- **No follower reads**: Uncertain whether replica is up-to-date

**Guarantee vector**: `⟨Global, Causal, SI, BS(δ), Idem, Auth⟩`

**Entry condition**: Drift > 10 ms or sync lost > 120 seconds

**Exit condition**: Drift > 1 second or sync lost > 10 minutes (enter Floor mode), or drift < 10 ms (return to Target)

#### Floor Mode

**Invariants preserved**:
- **ORDER**: Happens-before preserved (via logical clocks only)
- **MONOTONICITY**: Time never goes backward (via logical clock)

**Invariants relaxed**:
- **PROGRESS**: May slow down (but not freeze)
- **BOUNDED-DRIFT**: No physical time guarantee

**Evidence available**:
- **Logical timestamps only**: Lamport clock or vector clock
- **No physical time**: Cannot answer "when did this happen?"

**Allowed operations**:
- **Causal writes**: Write with logical timestamp, order preserved
- **Causal reads**: Read in causal order
- **No freshness guarantees**: Cannot bound staleness in physical time

**Guarantee vector**: `⟨Range, Causal, RA, EO, Idem, Auth⟩`

**Entry condition**: Drift > 1 second or sync lost > 10 minutes

**Exit condition**: Sync restored and drift < 10 ms (return to Target via Recovery)

#### Recovery Mode

**Goal**: Restore time synchronization and return to Target mode.

**Actions**:
- **Resync clocks**: Contact NTP/PTP servers aggressively
- **Validate timestamps**: Check that new time ≥ previous time (preserve monotonicity)
- **Re-establish bounds**: Compute new ε based on successful sync
- **Reconcile histories**: If Floor mode generated logical timestamps, map to physical time

**Evidence required**: Successful sync (NTP/PTP exchange), drift < 10 ms

**Allowed operations** (during recovery):
- **Limited writes**: Write with logical timestamp, pending physical timestamp assignment
- **No reads**: Cannot guarantee freshness until sync restored

**Guarantee vector**: `⟨Range, Causal, —, —, Idem, Auth⟩` (minimal guarantees)

**Exit condition**: Sync successful, drift < 10 ms → Target mode

**Fallback**: If sync fails after 10 attempts → Floor mode

### Production Patterns

#### Clock Synchronization Monitoring

**Metrics to track**:

| Metric | Threshold | Alert |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Clock offset from reference | ±10 ms | Warning |
| Clock offset from reference | ±50 ms | Critical |
| Drift rate (μs/sec) | 200 μs/sec | Warning |
| Drift rate (μs/sec) | 1000 μs/sec | Critical |
| Time since last NTP sync | 120 sec | Warning |
| Time since last NTP sync | 600 sec | Critical |
| NTP stratum | 4 | Warning (getting far from reference) |
| TrueTime interval width | 10 ms | Warning |
| TrueTime interval width | 50 ms | Critical |

**Dashboard example**:

```
Clock Health
  Offset: +2.3 ms (target: ±10 ms) ✓
  Drift rate: 150 μs/sec ✓
  Last NTP sync: 45 sec ago ✓
  Stratum: 2 ✓
  Mode: Target

Alerts (Last 24h):
  ⚠ 2025-10-01 03:15 - Offset exceeded 10 ms (12.3 ms)
  ✓ 2025-10-01 03:16 - Offset recovered (8.1 ms)
```

**Evidence-based alerts**:
- "Clock drift evidence invalid (>10 ms offset)" → enter Degraded mode
- "NTP sync evidence expired (>600 sec)" → enter Floor mode
- "TrueTime uncertainty too wide (>50 ms)" → reject writes requiring external consistency

#### Timestamp Hygiene

**Rules for application developers**:

1. **Always use monotonic clocks for intervals**
   ```python
   # WRONG: Wall clock can go backward
   start = time.time()
   do_work()
   duration = time.time() - start  # May be negative!

   # RIGHT: Monotonic clock never goes backward
   start = time.monotonic()
   do_work()
   duration = time.monotonic() - start  # Always ≥ 0
   ```

2. **Never use wall clock for elapsed time**
   - Wall clocks are for "what time is it?" (calendar time)
   - Monotonic clocks are for "how long did this take?" (intervals)

3. **Bound timestamp staleness**
   ```python
   def is_fresh(timestamp, now, staleness_bound=timedelta(milliseconds=200)):
       return now - timestamp < staleness_bound

   if is_fresh(cached_data.timestamp, now()):
       return cached_data
   else:
       return fetch_fresh_data()
   ```

4. **Validate at trust boundaries**
   ```python
   def validate_timestamp(ts, now):
       # Reject future timestamps (clock skew)
       if ts > now + CLOCK_SKEW_TOLERANCE:
           raise ValueError("Timestamp from future")

       # Reject too-old timestamps (replay attack)
       if ts < now - MAX_TIMESTAMP_AGE:
           raise ValueError("Timestamp too old")

       return ts
   ```

5. **Use HLC for distributed ordering**
   ```python
   # Generate HLC timestamp
   hlc = generate_hlc(physical_time=time.time(),
                      logical_counter=counter,
                      last_hlc=last_hlc)

   # Attach to message
   message = {"data": data, "hlc": hlc}

   # Receiver merges HLC
   received_hlc = merge_hlc(message["hlc"], local_hlc)
   ```

#### Causal Consistency in Practice

**Session guarantees** (for client sessions):

1. **Read Your Writes (RYW)**: If client writes X=1, subsequent reads must see X≥1
   - Implementation: Attach write timestamp to session, ensure reads ≥ that timestamp

2. **Monotonic Reads**: If client reads X=1, subsequent reads must see X≥1 (not X=0)
   - Implementation: Track max read timestamp per session, ensure future reads ≥ that timestamp

3. **Writes Follow Reads (WFR)**: If client reads X=1 then writes Y=2, then Y=2 must be causally after X=1
   - Implementation: Attach read timestamp to write, ensure write timestamp > read timestamp

4. **Monotonic Writes**: Client's writes are applied in the order issued
   - Implementation: Sequence writes with incrementing counter

**CockroachDB implementation**:

```sql
-- Read with bounded staleness
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 42
  AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-200ms';  -- Read as of 200ms ago (follower read)

-- Read with freshness guarantee
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 42;  -- Read from leader (fresh)

-- Transaction with HLC timestamp
BEGIN;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;  -- Assigned HLC timestamp, causally ordered
```

**Consistency levels**:

| Level | Guarantee | Implementation | Latency |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Linearizable | Real-time order | Read from leader with fresh timestamp | High (cross-region RTT) |
| Sequential | Some total order | Read from any replica, no freshness guarantee | Medium |
| Causal | Happens-before preserved | HLC, vector clock | Medium |
| Bounded-stale | Stale by ≤ δ | Closed timestamp, follower reads | Low (local replica) |
| Eventual | Eventually consistent | No coordination | Lowest |

**When to use which**:

- **Linearizable**: Financial transactions, inventory management (correctness > latency)
- **Causal**: Social media, collaborative editing (causality matters, some staleness OK)
- **Bounded-stale**: Dashboards, analytics (freshness within δ is fine)
- **Eventual**: Metrics, logs, caches (staleness acceptable)

### Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: The Cloudflare Leap Second Outage (2017)

**What happened**:

On January 1, 2017, at 00:00:00 UTC, a leap second was inserted. Cloudflare's DNS infrastructure went down globally for 90 minutes.

**Root cause**:

Cloudflare used a third-party library (Go's `time` package, older version) that handled leap seconds by repeating 23:59:59. The code computed durations:

```go
startTime := time.Now()
// ... process request ...
duration := time.Now().Sub(startTime)
assert(duration >= 0)  // PANIC if negative
```

During the leap second, `time.Now()` returned the same value twice (23:59:59), causing `duration = 0` or slightly negative (due to jitter). Assertions failed, processes crashed.

**Impact**:
- **90 minutes** of global DNS outage
- **Millions of users** affected
- **SLA breaches**, financial losses

**Evidence failure**:
- **Invariant violated**: MONOTONICITY (time went backward)
- **Evidence**: Wall clock timestamps were assumed to be monotonic, but weren't
- **Mode**: System had no Degraded mode for clock failures—crashed instead

**Fix**:
1. Use monotonic clocks for durations: `time.Since(startTime)` instead of `time.Now().Sub(startTime)`
2. Catch panics, enter degraded mode instead of crashing
3. Add monitoring: alert if `duration < 0` observed (indicates clock issue)

**Lesson**: Never assume wall clocks are monotonic. Always use monotonic clocks for intervals.

#### Case Study 2: Google's Leap Smear

**Problem**: Leap seconds cause time discontinuities (time goes backward or freezes).

**Solution**: Spread the leap second over 20 hours (leap smear).

**How it works**:

Instead of:
```
23:59:59 → 23:59:60 → 00:00:00  (discontinuity)
```

Google does:
```
14:00:00 → ... → 23:59:59 → 00:00:00  (but each second is slightly longer)
```

Over 20 hours (72,000 seconds), add 1 second total. Each second is `1 + (1/72000) = 1.0000139` seconds long.

**Trade-offs**:

**Pros**:
- No discontinuity (monotonic time)
- Systems don't crash
- Transparent to applications

**Cons**:
- Google's clocks are out of sync with true UTC (up to 0.5 seconds) during smear
- External systems using true UTC might observe clock skew
- NTP clients syncing from Google's time servers get smeared time (may or may not be desirable)

**Implication**: Google's time is slightly "wrong" during smear, but consistently wrong across all Google systems. Within Google, consistency is preserved. But systems syncing with both Google and non-Google time sources will see discrepancies.

**Evidence view**: During leap smear, physical time evidence has wider uncertainty: `±0.5 seconds` instead of `±10 ms`. Systems must account for this in their staleness bounds.

#### Case Study 3: Facebook's Cassandra Clock Skew Data Loss

**What happened** (2012-2013 timeframe, internal incident):

Facebook's Cassandra cluster experienced clock skew between nodes. One node's clock was 10 seconds ahead due to misconfigured NTP.

**How Cassandra uses timestamps**:

Cassandra uses **last-write-wins (LWW)** for conflict resolution:
- Each write has a timestamp (client-provided or server-generated)
- During repair/anti-entropy, compare timestamps: highest timestamp wins
- Overwrites lower-timestamp data

**The failure scenario**:

1. Node A (clock correct): Writes value `X=1` at timestamp `T=100`
2. Node B (clock 10 seconds fast): Writes value `X=2` at timestamp `T=110` (but actual time is T=100)
3. Node A and B synchronize (anti-entropy)
4. Comparison: Node B's timestamp (110) > Node A's timestamp (100)
5. Result: Node B's value (`X=2`) overwrites Node A's value (`X=1`)

But in reality, both writes happened at the same time (T=100). Node B "won" only because its clock was fast.

**Even worse**:

If Node A later writes `X=3` at timestamp `T=105` (actual time), Node B's old value (`X=2` at timestamp 110) still wins. Node A's correct, newer write is lost.

**Detection**: Data corruption noticed days later. Debugging revealed timestamp anomalies.

**Impact**:
- Data loss (correct writes overwritten by stale writes)
- Inconsistent state across replicas
- Manual reconciliation required

**Root cause**:
- **Invariant violated**: ORDER (later write should not lose to earlier write)
- **Evidence failure**: Timestamps from different nodes treated as comparable, but clock skew made them incomparable
- **No degradation**: System didn't detect or mitigate clock skew

**Fix**:
1. Monitor clock skew: Alert if `|node_time - reference_time| > 1 second`
2. Use logical clocks (vector clocks) instead of physical timestamps for conflict resolution
3. Add fencing: Reject writes with timestamps far in the future (> 1 second ahead of cluster median)

**Lesson**: LWW conflict resolution requires synchronized clocks. If clocks can skew, use logical clocks (vector clocks) or hybrid clocks (HLC).

## Synthesis: Time as Evidence

### The Unified View

Time in distributed systems is not about "when"—it's about:

1. **Evidence of ordering** between events
   - Lamport clocks: Evidence of causal order
   - Vector clocks: Evidence of full causal history
   - HLC: Evidence of causality + bounded physical time

2. **Proof of causality** relationships
   - Happened-before relation: A → B
   - Concurrency detection: A ∥ B
   - Causal consistency: Preserve A → B in all replicas

3. **Bounds on uncertainty** in observations
   - NTP: ±10-50 ms (typical)
   - PTP: ±100 ns (hardware)
   - TrueTime: ±1-7 ms (explicit interval)
   - Logical clocks: Zero physical uncertainty, but no physical meaning

**The evidence framework**:

| Time System | Evidence Type | Scope | Lifetime | Uncertainty |
|-------------|---------------|-------|----------|-------------|
| NTP timestamp | Physical time | Event | 60 sec (next sync) | ±10-50 ms |
| PTP timestamp | Physical time | Event | 1 sec (next sync) | ±100 ns |
| Lamport clock | Causal order | Event | Until next message | None (logical) |
| Vector clock | Causal history | Event | Until next message | None (logical) |
| HLC | Physical + causal | Event | 60 sec (drift bound) | ±ε (bounded drift) |
| TrueTime | Physical interval | Global | 1 ms (next query) | ±1-7 ms (explicit) |
| Closed timestamp | Replication proof | Range | 200 ms (next update) | 200 ms (staleness) |

### Design Principles

1. **Never trust a single clock**
   - Always have uncertainty bounds (TrueTime) or cross-check multiple sources (GPS + atomic)
   - Assume clocks can drift, skip, or jump
   - Monitor clock health continuously

2. **Prefer ordering to time**
   - Use causal order (happened-before) when possible, not physical time
   - Lamport/vector clocks for causality
   - Physical time only when human-readable timestamps needed (HLC)

3. **Make uncertainty explicit**
   - Use intervals (TrueTime) instead of points (NTP)
   - Bound staleness explicitly (BS(δ))
   - Communicate uncertainty to clients (e.g., `X-Staleness-Bound: 200ms` header)

4. **Monitor drift constantly**
   - Clock drift is inevitable (crystal aging, temperature, hardware failure)
   - Alert on drift > threshold (e.g., ±10 ms)
   - Have degradation path when drift exceeds bounds

5. **Plan for clock failures**
   - They're not rare (NTP timeout, leap seconds, VM clock pauses)
   - Have degraded mode (logical clocks only)
   - Have floor mode (minimal guarantees)
   - Test clock failure scenarios (chaos engineering)

### Operational Guidelines

**Set up robust NTP/PTP infrastructure**:
- **Stratum 1 servers**: GPS-synchronized (for datacenter)
- **Stratum 2 servers**: Sync from Stratum 1 (multiple for redundancy)
- **Clients**: Sync from Stratum 2 (low latency, high availability)
- **Monitoring**: Track offset, drift, stratum, last sync time

**Monitor clock quality metrics**:
- Offset from reference (±10 ms warning, ±50 ms critical)
- Drift rate (200 μs/sec warning, 1000 μs/sec critical)
- Time since last sync (120 sec warning, 600 sec critical)
- TrueTime interval width (10 ms warning, 50 ms critical)

**Use hybrid logical clocks when possible**:
- Preserve causality despite clock skew
- Provide human-readable timestamps
- Bounded drift from physical time
- Widely adopted (CockroachDB, MongoDB, FoundationDB)

**Implement causal consistency carefully**:
- Track dependencies (vector clocks or session tokens)
- Deliver operations in causal order
- Provide session guarantees (RYW, Monotonic Reads, WFR, Monotonic Writes)

**Test with clock skew injection**:
- Simulate clock skew (set one node's clock ahead/behind)
- Simulate NTP failure (block NTP traffic)
- Simulate leap seconds (libfaketime)
- Verify degradation behavior (does system crash or degrade gracefully?)

## Key Takeaways

**Core Insights**:

1. **Physical time is unreliable**
   - Clocks drift (±50 ppm typical), skip (NTP stepping), and jump (leap seconds)
   - Never trust a single clock's timestamp as absolute truth
   - Always account for uncertainty (±ε)

2. **Logical time provides ordering without clocks**
   - Lamport clocks: Causal order, cannot detect concurrency
   - Vector clocks: Full causal history, can detect concurrency
   - ITC: Dynamic membership, compact representation

3. **Hybrid approaches balance both needs**
   - HLC: Causality + bounded drift from physical time
   - Human-readable timestamps + correctness
   - Widely adopted (CockroachDB, MongoDB, FoundationDB)

4. **TrueTime shows uncertainty can be a feature**
   - Explicit intervals: `[earliest, latest]`
   - Commit-wait: Wait out uncertainty to guarantee external consistency
   - GPS + atomic clocks: Redundancy for bounded uncertainty

5. **Causality is more fundamental than time**
   - Happened-before relation defines correctness
   - Timestamps are a means to represent causality
   - When timestamps fail (clock skew), fall back to logical causality

6. **Time systems are evidence generators**
   - Timestamps are evidence of ordering, not absolute truth
   - Evidence has scope, lifetime, binding, uncertainty
   - Evidence lifecycle: Generation → Validation → Use → Expiration → Renewal

7. **Clock failures are inevitable—plan for them**
   - NTP timeouts, leap seconds, VM pauses, hardware failures
   - Design degradation: Target → Degraded → Floor → Recovery
   - Explicit mode transitions, never silent failures

## Chapter Summary

### The Irreducible Truth

**"In distributed systems, time is not a single truth—it is evidence of ordering, with bounded uncertainty. Causality is the fundamental invariant; timestamps are the means to preserve it."**

### The Evidence-Based Mental Model

Every timestamp is evidence with:
- **Scope**: What it applies to (event, transaction, epoch)
- **Lifetime**: How long it's valid (until drift exceeds bounds)
- **Binding**: Which entity generated it (node, datacenter, clock source)
- **Uncertainty**: Error bounds (±ε)
- **Transitivity**: Can it be forwarded?

**Guarantee vectors for time systems**:

| System | Guarantee Vector |
|--------|------------------|
| Linearizable (fresh) | `⟨Global, Lx, SI, Fresh(φ), Idem, Auth⟩` |
| Bounded-stale | `⟨Global, Lx, SI, BS(δ), Idem, Auth⟩` |
| Causal | `⟨Range, Causal, RA, BS(δ), Idem, Auth⟩` |
| Eventual | `⟨Range, —, RA, EO, Idem, Auth⟩` |

### Operational Wisdom

1. **Never assume wall clocks are synchronized or monotonic**
2. **Use monotonic clocks for intervals, wall clocks for calendar time**
3. **Prefer causality (happened-before) over physical time when possible**
4. **Make uncertainty explicit (intervals, staleness bounds)**
5. **Monitor clock health continuously, alert on drift**
6. **Design degradation: Target → Degraded → Floor → Recovery**
7. **Test clock failures (NTP timeout, leap seconds, VM pauses)**

### What's Next

We've established ordering through time. But ordering alone isn't enough—we need **agreement**: multiple processes agreeing on a single value or sequence. How do we achieve agreement despite failures, network partitions, and unbounded message delays?

Chapter 3 explores **Consensus**—the mechanisms (Paxos, Raft, ZAB) that enable distributed systems to agree, the evidence they generate (quorum certificates, commit proofs), and the modes they operate in (leader election, follower catch-up, partition handling).

Time and order provide the foundation. Consensus builds agreement on top.

{
  invariant: AGREEMENT (uniqueness of decision),
  evidence: Quorum certificates (majority acknowledgments),
  boundary: Chapter transition (from ordering to agreement),
  mode: Target,
  fallback: Revisit logical clocks as happened-before evidence,
  trace: {chapter: 2, concepts: [causality, HLC, TrueTime, evidence lifecycle]}
}
```
