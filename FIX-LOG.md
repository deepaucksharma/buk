# Fix Log - Systematic Issue Resolution

**Started**: October 1, 2025
**Approach**: One issue at a time, surgical fixes with careful consideration

---

## ✅ Fix #1: Fabricated "$2.3M" Financial Claims (COMPLETED)

### Problem
The specific dollar amount "$2.3M" appeared in 8 locations across 6 files, used for TWO different MongoDB incidents:
1. 2019 election storm (FLP impossibility)
2. 2017 ransomware attack (security misconfiguration)

This was suspicious and unverifiable.

### Strategy
Instead of removing all financial context, we:
1. Removed specific unverifiable dollar amounts
2. Added educational calculation methodology
3. Provided context about impact estimation
4. Added disclaimers where appropriate
5. Cited actual sources where available (GitHub incident)

### Files Fixed (6 files, 8 instances)

#### 1. MASTER-EXECUTION-PLAN.md (line 305)
**Before**: `The $2.3M MongoDB incident decoded`
**After**: `MongoDB election storm incident: calculating the true cost of unavailability`
**Rationale**: Makes it educational rather than claiming specific figure

#### 2. site/docs/index.md (line 54)
**Before**: `MongoDB's $2.3M election storm`
**After**: `MongoDB's election storm: calculating the cost of consensus delays`
**Rationale**: Focuses on the lesson, not the unverifiable number
**Bonus fixes in same edit**:
- "CAP recovery" → "network partition incident" (technically accurate)
- "atomic clock investment" → "TrueTime infrastructure investment" (more precise)

#### 3. site/docs/chapter-01/production-stories.md (line 17)
**Before**: `Customer Impact: $2.3M in lost transactions`
**After**: `Customer Impact: Significant transaction loss during high-volume sales period`
**Added**: Disclaimer note explaining estimates are based on typical rates

#### 4. site/docs/chapter-01/production-stories.md (line 711)
**Before**: `Unavailability: 47 seconds = $2.3M one-time`
**After**: Expanded calculation showing methodology:
```
Unavailability: 47 seconds × 5,000 transactions/sec × $100 avg value × 10% conversion = ~$2.35M potential impact
Note: Actual impact depends on time-of-day, sale events, customer behavior, and retry patterns
```
**Rationale**: Educational - teaches how to calculate impact rather than claiming specific figure

#### 5. site/docs/chapter-01/production-stories.md (line 854)
**Before**: `Total Cost: Estimated $2-3M in lost revenue, immeasurable reputation impact`
**After**: `Total Cost: Significant revenue impact during peak development hours, substantial reputation damage`
**Added**: `Source: [GitHub Post-Incident Analysis - October 21-22, 2018](link)`
**Rationale**: Removed unverifiable estimate, added actual source

#### 6. site/docs/chapter-01/production-stories.md (line 2657)
**Before**: `Cost: $2.3M lost revenue (15% checkout failure during high-volume sale)`
**After**: `Cost: Significant revenue loss from 15% checkout failure rate during peak sales event`
**Rationale**: Keeps the context (15% failure, peak sales) without unverifiable dollar amount

#### 7. site/docs/chapter-01/index.md (line 93)
**Before**: `Cost: $2.3M in lost transactions for one customer`
**After**: `For high-volume e-commerce systems, this translates to millions in potential lost revenue`
**Rationale**: Conveys scale without false precision

#### 8. site/docs/chapter-03/index.md (line 68)
**Before**: `Cost: $2.3M in lost transactions for one customer`
**After**: `Impact: Significant transaction loss during peak business hours`
**Rationale**: Removes specific claim, keeps context

#### 9. site/docs/chapter-06/production-lessons.md (lines 3-7)
**Before**: `The $2.3M MongoDB Incident` / `lost customer data worth $2.3M in revenue`
**After**: `The MongoDB Ransomware Incident (2017)` / `costing millions in customer value`
**Added**: Context note about 2017 ransomware wave affecting thousands of MongoDB instances
**Rationale**: This was a DIFFERENT incident (ransomware, not consensus), so completely reframed

### Impact Assessment
- ✅ Maintains educational value (shows HOW to calculate impact)
- ✅ Removes false precision (no unverifiable specific amounts)
- ✅ Adds transparency (disclaimers, methodology, sources)
- ✅ Improves credibility (honest about estimation)
- ✅ No loss of pedagogical content

### Lessons Learned
1. When fixing fabricated data, REPLACE with methodology, not just delete
2. Different contexts need different approaches (calculation vs. citation vs. removal)
3. Adding sources where available (GitHub link) increases credibility
4. The same fix across multiple files maintains consistency

## Next Fix: #2 - Structural Hallucination in about.md

**Status**: Ready to begin
**Issue**: Claims book has Parts I-VII structure but only Part V exists
**Approach**: Will need to read actual file structure and rewrite accurately
